How to use
==========

The `BLOB support in Plone`__ is amazing for a lot of reasons.

__ https://pypi.org/project/plone.app.blob

However Plone will raise errors when you visit a file content that use BLOB support without also having the BLOB file.

For developers this can be a little bit boring.
It's quite common to copy a production ``Data.fs`` for developing using production data, but you don't always want to copy all blobs.

This product monkey-patches parts of Plone, so that visiting objects that store content in the blob storage without having the BLOB available will not lead to errors.
Instead a file only containing the string "File created by experimental.gracefulblobmissing." is created in the place where the blob-file should be.


Requirements
============

This product has been tested on:

* Plone 5.1
* Plone 5.2
