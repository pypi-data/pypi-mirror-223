   # Manipulate or process the data...

   # Write data into a JZD file
   jzdfile.write('path/to/jzdfile.zip', 'ClassName', data)

   # List all class names in a JZD file
   class_list = jzdfile.list_class('path/to/jzdfile.zip')

   # Delete a class from a JZD file
   deleted = jzdfile.delete_class('path/to/jzdfile.zip', 'ClassName')
