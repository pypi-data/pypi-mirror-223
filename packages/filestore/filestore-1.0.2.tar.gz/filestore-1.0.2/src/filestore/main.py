"""
This module contains the FastStore class which is used to upload files to a storage service such as local, cloud,
or memory. It also contains the FileData class which is used to return the result of a file storage operation.
The Result class is used to return the result of a file storage operation. It also contains helper functions for the
FastStore class configuration.

Functions:
    file_filter (Callable[[Request, Form, str, UploadFile], bool]): The default filter function for the FastStore class.
    filename Callable[[Request, Form, str, UploadFile], UploadFile]: Update the filename of the file object.

Classes:
    Config: The configuration for the FastStore class. This is a TypedDict not a Pydantic model.
    FileData: The result of a file storage operation. A Pydantic model.
    Result: The result of a file storage operation. A Pydantic model.
    FastStore: The base class for all storage services. An abstract class.
