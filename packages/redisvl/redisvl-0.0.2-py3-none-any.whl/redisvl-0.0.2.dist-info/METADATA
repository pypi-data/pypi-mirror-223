RedisVL provides a powerful Python client library for using Redis as a Vector Database. Leverage the speed and reliability of Redis along with vector-based semantic search capabilities to supercharge your application!

**Note**: This supported by Redis, Inc. on a good faith effort basis. To report bugs, request features, or receive assistance, please [file an issue](https://github.com/RedisVentures/redisvl/issues).


------------


## ðŸš€ What is RedisVL?

Vector databases have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their ability to store and retrieve vectors efficiently. However, most vector databases are complex to use and require a lot of time and effort to set up. RedisVL aims to solve this problem by providing a simple and intuitive interface for using Redis as a vector database.

RedisVL provides a client library that enables you to harness the power of Redis as a vector database. This library simplifies the process of storing, retrieving, and performing semantic searches on vectors in Redis. It also provides a robust index management system that allows you to create, update, and delete indices with ease.


### Capabilities

RedisVL has a host of powerful features designed to streamline your vector database operations.

1. **Index Management**: RedisVL allows for indices to be created, updated, and deleted with ease. A schema for each index can be defined in yaml or directly in python code and used throughout the lifetime of the index.

2. **Embedding Creation**: RedisVL integrates with OpenAI and other text embedding providers to simplify the process of vectorizing unstructured data. *Image support coming soon.*

3. **Vector Search**: RedisVL provides robust search capabilities that enable you to query vectors synchronously and asynchronously. Hybrid queries that utilize tag, geographic, numeric, and other filters like full-text search are also supported.

4. **Powerful Abstractions**
    - **Semantic Caching**: `LLMCache` is a semantic caching interface built directly into RedisVL. It allows for the caching of generated output from LLMs like GPT-3 and others. As semantic search is used to check the cache, a threshold can be set to determine if the cached result is relevant enough to be returned. If not, the model is called and the result is cached for future use. This can increase the QPS and reduce the cost of using LLM models in production.


## ðŸ˜Š Quick Start

Please note that this library is still under heavy development, and while you can quickly try RedisVL and deploy it in a production environment, the API may be subject to change at any time.

`pip install redisvl` (Coming Soon)

## Example Usage

### Index Management

Indices can be defined through yaml specification that corresponds directly to the RediSearch field names and arguments in redis-py

```yaml
index:
  name: user_index
  storage_type: hash
  prefix: users

fields:
  # define tag fields
  tag:
  - name: user
  - name: job
  - name: credit_store
  # define numeric fields
  numeric:
  - name: age
  # define vector fields
  vector:
  - name: user_embedding
    algorithm: hnsw
    distance_metric: cosine
```

This would correspond to a dataset that looked something like

| user  | age |     job    | credit_score |           user_embedding          |
|-------|-----|------------|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| john  |  1  |  engineer  |     high     | \x3f\x8c\xcc\x3f\x8c\xcc?@         |
| mary  |  2  |   doctor   |     low      | \x3f\x8c\xcc\x3f\x8c\xcc?@         |
|  joe  |  3  |  dentist   |    medium    | \x3f\xab\xcc?\xab\xcc?@         |


With the schema, the RedisVL library can be used to create, load vectors and perform vector searches
```python

from redisvl.index import SearchIndex
from redisvl.query import VectorQuery

# initialize the index and connect to Redis
index = SearchIndex.from_dict(schema)
index.connect("redis://localhost:6379")

# create the index in Redis
index.create(overwrite=True)

# load data into the index in Redis (list of dicts)
index.load(data)

query = VectorQuery(
    vector=[0.1, 0.1, 0.5],
    vector_field_name="user_embedding",
    return_fields=["user", "age", "job", "credit_score"],
    num_results=3,
)
results = index.search(query.query, query_params=query.params)

```

### Semantic cache

The ``LLMCache`` Interface in RedisVL can be used as follows.

```python
from redisvl.llmcache.semantic import SemanticCache

cache = SemanticCache(
  redis_url="redis://localhost:6379",
  threshold=0.9, # semantic similarity threshold
)

# check if the cache has a result for a given query
cache.check("What is the capital of France?")
[ ]

# store a result for a given query
cache.store("What is the capital of France?", "Paris")

# Cache will now have the query
cache.check("What is the capital of France?")
["Paris"]

# Cache will still return the result if the query is similar enough
cache.check("What really is the capital of France?")
["Paris"]
```
