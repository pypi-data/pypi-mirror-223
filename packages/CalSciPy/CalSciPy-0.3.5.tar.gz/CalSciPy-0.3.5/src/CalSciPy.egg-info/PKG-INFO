This python packages contains a variety of useful tools for handling, processing, visualizing, & designing calcium 
imaging experiments. I noticed I was constantly re-writing boilerplate, "one-liners", and copy/pasting code between
environments. I wrote this so ~I don't have to~ you don't have to. It's intended to be a collection of useful, 
well-documented functions often used in boilerplate code alongside software packages such as 
[Caiman](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/CaImAn), [SIMA](https://github.com/losonczylab/sima), 
and [Suite2P](https://github.com/MouseLand/suite2p), as well as a collection of more bespoke software designed for use 
with Bruker's PrairieView Imaging Software and MeadowLark Spatial Light Modulators. Essentially, it's a collection of 
code written for my imaging experiments that might be considered useful to others.

#### Active Development
* The current implementation is unstable and should be considered an open beta.

#### Highlights
* Assign unique colormaps to subsets of ROIs to generate rich, informative videos
* Perona-Malik diffusion for edge-preserving denoising
* Fast, convenient functions for handling, aligning, and compiling data collected in Bruker's PrairieView software
* Functions for generating protocols for use in Bruker's Prairieview.
* Interactive visualization of data
