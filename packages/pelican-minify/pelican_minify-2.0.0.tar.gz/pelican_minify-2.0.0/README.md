============================

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/pelican-plugins/minify/main.yml?branch=main)](https://github.com/pelican-plugins/minify/actions)
[![PyPI Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pelican-minify)](https://pypi.org/project/pelican-minify/)

This Pelican plugin can compress HTML & CSS files as well as inline CSS and JavaScript in HTML files.

Requirements
------------

Because this plugin depends on the [`minify-html`](https://pypi.org/project/minify-html) Python package, which in turn utilizes the Rust-based [`minify-html`](https://github.com/wilsonzlin/minify-html) project, you must have Cargo (the Rust package manager) installed and available on your `PATH`. Rust and Cargo can be installed on Mac systems via Homebrew:

    brew install rust

Alternatively, Rust and Cargo can be installed via your particular systemâ€™s package manager or via: <https://rustup.rs/>

Installation
------------

This plugin can be installed via:

    python -m pip install pelican-minify

As long as you have not explicitly added a `PLUGINS` setting to your Pelican settings file, then the newly-installed plugin should be automatically detected and enabled. Otherwise, you must add `minify` to your existing `PLUGINS` list. For more information, please see the [How to Use Plugins](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/plugins.html#how-to-use-plugins) documentation.

Usage
-----

By default, all HTML and CSS files will be compressed, including inline JavaScript and CSS rules in `<script>` and `<style>` tags.

To configure the behavior of the plugin, add the following variables in your Pelican settings file (values shown here are the default values):

```python
CSS_MIN = True
HTML_MIN = True
INLINE_CSS_MIN = True
INLINE_JS_MIN = True
```

Please note that `INLINE_CSS_MIN` and `INLINE_JS_MIN` require that `HTML_MIN` be enabled.
