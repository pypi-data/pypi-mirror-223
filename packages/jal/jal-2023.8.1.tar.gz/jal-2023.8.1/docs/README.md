### Installation

*jal* was created to be portable and cross-platform. Thus, you have several ways to install and run the program:
- You may get file archive from [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/titov-vv/jal), unpack it into suitable directory on your PC and use `run.py` to start application.
In order to succeed this way you need to have at least Python 3.8.1 and satisfy all dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. Let's say some words about installing python on windows-based computers, as this application becomes poplular for non-programming people. The best place to download python distro is official site, sure. Important, in installer dialogues to check boxes for installing `pip` and `Add python to environment variables`. Don't forget to reboot windows to be sure, that changes applies correctly.

- You may use installation package with `pip install jal` command. It will take care about dependencies automatically and will install `jal` entry point<sup>*</sup> to run the program. For windows-users the best and easiest way is to start windows command prompt (cmd) and run command mentioned above in it. If python set up correctly and installation succeeded you may just type `jal` to run application.
Alternatively you may use `python -m jal.jal` if you can't run application with `jal` entry point.
- You may mix two methods together - download source files from github and then use `setup.py` for preferred way of installation.

Database will be initialized automatically with minimal required set of data, and you will be able to start use the program.

<sup>*</sup> - entry point location is platform dependable. E.g. on Linux it might be in `~/.local/run`, on Windows - `Scripts` directory of your python installation or `Appdata/Roaming/Python/.../Scripts/` in user profile path.

### Upgrades
If you installed *jal* via *pip* then you may upgrade it to newer version with help of command `pip install jal -U`
