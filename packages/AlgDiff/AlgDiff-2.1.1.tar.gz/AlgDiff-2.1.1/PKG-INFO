        Installation
        ------------
        
        
        
        To use AlgDiff using pip run the following in the command line: 
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
           $ pip install AlgDiff
        
        
        .. _examples:
        
        Some examples
        ----------------
        
        To initialize an algebraic differentiator with parameter :math:`T=0.1`, :math:`\alpha=\beta=4`, :math:`N=0` and a sampling period of the measured signal equal to :math:`ts=0.01` do the following:
        
        >>> from AlgDiff import *
        >>> g = AlgebraicDifferentiator(N=0,alpha=4.,beta=4,T=0.1, ts=0.01)
        
        The cutoff frequency in rad/s of this differentiator can be computed by
        
        >>> wc = g.get_cutoffFreq()
        
        
        The first order derivative of a signal :math:`y` given as a numpy array and sampled by :math:`ts=0.01` can be achieved by
        
        >>> dydt = g.estimateDer(1,y) # y is a numpy array
        
        Further detailed examples are provided in the `jupyter notebooks <https://github.com/aothmane-control/Algebraic-differentiators/tree/master/examples>`_ given the repository. Therein three different notebooks are provided:
        
        - A `quick start <https://github.com/aothmane-control/Algebraic-differentiators/blob/master/examples/QuickStart.ipynb>`_ with a very brief introduction
        - A `detailed discussion <https://github.com/aothmane-control/Algebraic-differentiators/blob/master/examples/DetailedExamples.ipynb>`_ of algebraic differentiators
        - The `simultaneous <https://github.com/aothmane-control/Algebraic-differentiators/blob/master/examples/EliminationDisturbancesExample.ipynb>`_ simultaneous elimination of a harmonic disturbance and approximation of derivatives
