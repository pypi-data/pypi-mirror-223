# # Path and CrossSection
#
# You can create a `Path` in gdsfactory and extrude it with an arbitrary `CrossSection`.
#
# Lets create a path:
#
# - Create a blank `Path`.
# - Append points to the `Path` either using the built-in functions (`arc()`, `straight()`, `euler()` ...) or by providing your own lists of points
# - Specify `CrossSection` with layers and offsets.
# - Extrude `Path` with a `CrossSection` to create a Component with the path polygons in it.

# ## Path
#
# The first step is to generate the list of points we want the path to follow.
# Let's start out by creating a blank `Path` and using the built-in functions to
# make a few smooth turns.

p1 = gf.path.straight(length=5)
p2 = gf.path.euler(radius=5, angle=45, p=0.5, use_eff=False)
p = p1 + p2
f = p.plot()

p1 = gf.path.straight(length=5)
p2 = gf.path.euler(radius=5, angle=45, p=0.5, use_eff=False)
p = p2 + p1
f = p.plot()

# +
P = gf.Path()
P += gf.path.arc(radius=10, angle=90)  # Circular arc
P += gf.path.straight(length=10)  # Straight section
P += gf.path.euler(radius=3, angle=-90)  # Euler bend (aka "racetrack" curve)
P += gf.path.straight(length=40)
P += gf.path.arc(radius=8, angle=-45)
P += gf.path.straight(length=10)
P += gf.path.arc(radius=8, angle=45)
P += gf.path.straight(length=10)

f = P.plot()
# -

p2 = P.copy().rotate()
f = p2.plot()

P.points - p2.points

# You can also modify our Path in the same ways as any other gdsfactory object:
#
# - Manipulation with `move()`, `rotate()`, `mirror()`, etc
# - Accessing properties like `xmin`, `y`, `center`, `bbox`, etc

P.movey(10)
P.xmin = 20
f = P.plot()

# You can also check the length of the curve with the `length()` method:

P.length()

# ## CrossSection
#
# Now that you've got your path defined, the next step is to define the cross-section of the path. To do this, you can create a blank `CrossSection` and add whatever cross-sections you want to it.
# You can then combine the `Path` and the `CrossSection` using the `gf.path.extrude()` function to generate a Component:
#
#
# ### Option 1: Single layer and width cross-section
#
# The simplest option is to just set the cross-section to be a constant width by passing a number to `extrude()` like so:

# Extrude the Path and the CrossSection
c = gf.path.extrude(P, layer=(1, 0), width=1.5)
c.plot()

# ### Option 2: Linearly-varying width
#
# A slightly more advanced version is to make the cross-section width vary linearly from start to finish by passing a 2-element list to `extrude()` like so:

# Extrude the Path and the CrossSection
c = gf.path.extrude(P, layer=(1, 0), widths=(1, 3))
c.plot()

# ### Option 3: Arbitrary Cross-section
#
# You can also extrude an arbitrary cross_section

# Now, what if we want a more complicated straight?  For instance, in some
# photonic applications it's helpful to have a shallow etch that appears on either
# side of the straight (often called a trench or sleeve).  Additionally, it might be nice
# to have a Port on either end of the center section so we can snap other
# geometries to it.  Let's try adding something like that in:

# +
p = gf.path.straight()

# Add a few "sections" to the cross-section
s1 = gf.Section(width=2, offset=2, layer=(2, 0))
s2 = gf.Section(width=2, offset=-2, layer=(2, 0))
x = gf.CrossSection(
    width=1, offset=0, layer=(1, 0), port_names=("in", "out"), sections=[s1, s2]
)

c = gf.path.extrude(p, cross_section=x)
c.plot()

# +
p = gf.path.arc()

# Combine the Path and the CrossSection
b = gf.path.extrude(p, cross_section=x)
b.plot()
# -

# ## Building Paths quickly
#
# You can pass `append()` lists of path segments.  This makes it easy to combine
# paths very quickly.  Below we show 3 examples using this functionality:
#
# **Example 1:** Assemble a complex path by making a list of Paths and passing it
# to `append()`

# +
P = gf.Path()

# Create the basic Path components
left_turn = gf.path.euler(radius=4, angle=90)
right_turn = gf.path.euler(radius=4, angle=-90)
straight = gf.path.straight(length=10)

# Assemble a complex path by making list of Paths and passing it to `append()`
P.append(
    [
        straight,
        left_turn,
        straight,
        right_turn,
        straight,
        straight,
        right_turn,
        left_turn,
        straight,
    ]
)

f = P.plot()
# -

P = (
    straight
    + left_turn
    + straight
    + right_turn
    + straight
    + straight
    + right_turn
    + left_turn
    + straight
)
f = P.plot()

# **Example 2:** Create an "S-turn" just by making a list of `[left_turn,
# right_turn]`

# +
P = gf.Path()

# Create an "S-turn" just by making a list
s_turn = [left_turn, right_turn]

P.append(s_turn)
f = P.plot()
# -

# **Example 3:** Repeat the S-turn 3 times by nesting our S-turn list in another
# list

# +
P = gf.Path()

# Create an "S-turn" using a list
s_turn = [left_turn, right_turn]

# Repeat the S-turn 3 times by nesting our S-turn list 3x times in another list
triple_s_turn = [s_turn, s_turn, s_turn]

P.append(triple_s_turn)
f = P.plot()
# -

# Note you can also use the Path() constructor to immediately construct your Path:

P = gf.Path([straight, left_turn, straight, right_turn, straight])
f = P.plot()

# ## Waypoint smooth paths
#
# You can also build smooth paths between waypoints with the `smooth()` function

points = np.array([(20, 10), (40, 10), (20, 40), (50, 40), (50, 20), (70, 20)])
plt.plot(points[:, 0], points[:, 1], ".-")
plt.axis("equal")

# +
points = np.array([(20, 10), (40, 10), (20, 40), (50, 40), (50, 20), (70, 20)])

P = gf.path.smooth(
    points=points,
    radius=2,
    bend=gf.path.euler,  # Alternatively, use pp.arc
    use_eff=False,
)
f = P.plot()
# -

# ## Waypoint sharp paths
#
# It's also possible to make more traditional angular paths (e.g. electrical wires) in a few different ways.
#
# **Example 1:** Using a simple list of points

P = gf.Path([(20, 10), (30, 10), (40, 30), (50, 30), (50, 20), (70, 20)])
f = P.plot()

# **Example 2:** Using the "turn and move" method, where you manipulate the end angle of the Path so that when you append points to it, they're in the correct direction.  *Note: It is crucial that the number of points per straight section is set to 2 (`gf.path.straight(length, num_pts = 2)`) otherwise the extrusion algorithm will show defects.*

P = gf.Path()
P += gf.path.straight(length=10, npoints=2)
P.end_angle += 90  # "Turn" 90 deg (left)
P += gf.path.straight(length=10, npoints=2)  # "Walk" length of 10
P.end_angle += -135  # "Turn" -135 degrees (right)
P += gf.path.straight(length=15, npoints=2)  # "Walk" length of 10
P.end_angle = 0  # Force the direction to be 0 degrees
P += gf.path.straight(length=10, npoints=2)  # "Walk" length of 10
f = P.plot()

# ## Custom curves
#
# Now let's have some fun and try to make a loop-de-loop structure with parallel
# straights and several Ports.
#
# To create a new type of curve we simply make a function that produces an array
# of points.  The best way to do that is to create a function which allows you to
# specify a large number of points along that curve -- in the case below, the
# `looploop()` function outputs 1000 points along a looping path.  Later, if we
# want reduce the number of points in our geometry we can trivially `simplify` the
# path.
#


# +
def looploop(num_pts=1000):
    """Simple limacon looping curve"""
    t = np.linspace(-np.pi, 0, num_pts)
    r = 20 + 25 * np.sin(t)
    x = r * np.cos(t)
    y = r * np.sin(t)
    return np.array((x, y)).T


# Create the path points
P = gf.Path()

# Create the crosssection
s1 = gf.Section(width=0.5, offset=2, layer=(2, 0))
s2 = gf.Section(width=0.5, offset=4, layer=(3, 0))
s3 = gf.Section(width=1, offset=0, layer=(4, 0))
X = gf.CrossSection(
    width=1.5, offset=0, layer=(1, 0), port_names=["in", "out"], sections=[s1, s2, s3]
)

c = gf.path.extrude(P, X)
c.plot()
# -

# You can create Paths from any array of points -- just be sure that they form
# smooth curves!  If we examine our path `P` we can see that all we've simply
# created a long list of points:

path_points = P.points  # Curve points are stored as a numpy array in P.points
print(np.shape(path_points))  # The shape of the array is Nx2
print(len(P))  # Equivalently, use len(P) to see how many points are inside

# ## Simplifying / reducing point usage
#
# One of the chief concerns of generating smooth curves is that too many points
# are generated, inflating file sizes and making boolean operations
# computationally expensive.  Fortunately, PHIDL has a fast implementation of the
# [Ramer-Douglasâ€“Peucker
# algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramer%E2%80%93Douglas%E2%80%93Peucker_algorithm)
# that lets you reduce the number of points in a curve without changing its shape.
# All that needs to be done is when you  made a component `component()` extruding the path with a cross_section, you specify the
# `simplify` argument.
#
# If we specify `simplify = 1e-3`, the number of points in the line drops from
# 12,000 to 4,000, and the remaining points form a line that is identical to
# within `1e-3` distance from the original (for the default 1 micron unit size,
# this corresponds to 1 nanometer resolution):

# The remaining points form a identical line to within `1e-3` from the original
c = gf.path.extrude(p=P, cross_section=X, simplify=1e-3)
c.plot()

# Let's say we need fewer points.  We can increase the simplify tolerance by
# specifying `simplify = 1e-1`.  This drops the number of points to ~400 points
# form a line that is identical to within `1e-1` distance from the original:

c = gf.path.extrude(P, cross_section=X, simplify=1e-1)
c.plot()

# Taken to absurdity, what happens if we set `simplify = 0.3`?  Once again, the
# ~200 remaining points form a line that is within `0.3` units from the original
# -- but that line looks pretty bad.

c = gf.path.extrude(P, cross_section=X, simplify=0.3)
c.plot()

# ## Curvature calculation
#
# The `Path` class has a `curvature()` method that computes the curvature `K` of
# your smooth path (K = 1/(radius of curvature)).  This can be helpful for
# verifying that your curves transition smoothly such as in [track-transition
# curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_transition_curve) (also known as
# "Euler" bends in the photonics world). Euler bends have lower mode-mismatch loss as explained in [this paper](https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-27-22-31394&id=422321)
#
# Note this curvature is numerically computed so areas where the curvature jumps
# instantaneously (such as between an arc and a straight segment) will be slightly
# interpolated, and sudden changes in point density along the curve can cause
# discontinuities.

# ## Transitioning between cross-sections
#
# Often a critical element of building paths is being able to transition between
# cross-sections.  You can use the `transition()` function to do exactly this: you
# simply feed it two `CrossSection`s and it will output a new `CrossSection` that
# smoothly transitions between the two.
#
# Let's start off by creating two cross-sections we want to transition between.
# Note we give all the cross-sectional elements names by specifying the `name`
# argument in the `add()` function -- this is important because the transition
# function will try to match names between the two input cross-sections, and any
# names not present in both inputs will be skipped.

# function that is parameterized from 0 to 1: for an example function
