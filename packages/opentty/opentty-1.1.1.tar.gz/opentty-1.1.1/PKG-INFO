Description: OpenTTY 1.1.1 "The ROOT Update"
        
        	In this release Mr. Lima had fixed many
        bugs with permission plugin like sync in 1.1
        doesnt works 'cause PSH didnt sent information
        for app that it was running with superuser 
        permission. 
        
        1. Fixed SYNC Permission denied.
        
        	In 1.1 command sync was blocked for root
        only, but PSH didnt sent the superuser config
        for applet and it cant be runned. To upgrade
        from 1.1 to 1.1.1 run command:
        
        	'pip install --upgrade opentty'
        
        	It will update your local version of opentty
        to PyPi latest release. Dont remember to update,
        it become your experience with opentty better and
        bring more security for users. 
        
        2. Now command not found error stop script execution
        
        	Command continue excuting after a unknown 
        command report is a "bug" in code, it was forgotted
        by Mr. Lima since 1.0rc4 the first official release
        at PyPi.
