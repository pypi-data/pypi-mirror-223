# EasyDeL

EasyDeL (Easy Deep Learning) is an open-source library designed to accelerate and optimize the training process of
machine learning models. This library is primarily focused on Jax/Flax and plans to offer easy and fine solutions to
train Flax/Jax Models on the `TPU/GPU`

## Installation

### Availalbe on PyPi

To install EasyDeL, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install easydel
```

### PyGit

for the latest version (beta)

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/erfanzar/EasyDel
```

## Available Models Are

- Llama     (Support `FSDP`, `MP`,` DP`)(_Supports gradient checkpointing_)
- GPT-J     (Support `FSDP`, `MP`,` DP`)(_Supports gradient checkpointing_)
- LT        (Support `FSDP`, `MP`, `DP`)(_Supports gradient checkpointing_)
- MosaicMPT (Support `FSDP`, `MP`,` DP`)(_Supports gradient checkpointing_)
- GPTNeoX   (Support `FSDP`, `MP`, `DP`)(_Supports gradient checkpointing_)
- Falcon    (Support `FSDP`, `MP`, `DP`)(_Supports gradient checkpointing_)
- Palm      (Support `FSDP`, `MP`, `DP`)(_Supports gradient checkpointing_)
- T5        (Support `FSDP`, `MP`, `DP`)(_Supports gradient checkpointing_)


- _LLama GPT-J MosaicMPT Falcon supports Flash Attention_

you can also tell me the model you want in Flax/Jax version and ill try my best to build it ;)

## Tutorials

_Tutorials on how to use and train or serve your models with EasyDel is available at examples dir_

## FineTuning

with using EasyDel FineTuning LLM (CausalLanguageModels) are easy as much as possible with using Jax and Flax
and having the benefit of TPUs for the best speed here's a simple code to use in order to finetune your own MPT / LLama
or any other models supported by EasyDel

#### Step One

download converted model weights in order to finetune or convert the weights of the model you want to use
weight_convertor in the library example

```python
import jax
from EasyDel.weight_convertor.mpt import convert_pt_to_flax_7b
from fjutils.utils import save_ckpt

number_of_layers = 32  # its 32 hidden layers for Mpt 7B
device = jax.devices('cpu')[0]  # offload on CPU

pytorch_model_state_dict = None  # StateDict of the model should be this one
flax_params = convert_pt_to_flax_7b(pytorch_model_state_dict, number_of_layers, device)
save_ckpt(flax_params, 'flax_param_easydel')
```

#### Functional Programing method

#### Step Two

now it's time to finetune or model

```python
import jax.numpy
from EasyDel import TrainArguments, CausalLMTrainer
from datasets import load_dataset
from EasyDel.configs import configs

max_length = 4096
conf = configs.mpt_configs['7b']
conf['max_sequence_length'] = max_length
conf['max_seq_len'] = max_length

train_args = TrainArguments(
    model_id='erfanzar/FlaxMpt-7B',
    # right now you should use model supported with remote code from huggingface all model are supported and uploaded
    model_name='my_first_model_to_train_using_easydel',
    num_train_epochs=3,
    learning_rate=1e-5,
    learning_rate_end=1e-6,
    optimizer='lion',  # 'adamw', 'lion', 'adafactor','warm_up_cosine' are supported
    scheduler='linear',  # 'linear' or 'cosine' or 'none'
    weight_decay=0.01,
    total_batch_size=16,
    max_steps=None,  # None to let trainer Decide
    do_train=True,
    do_eval=False,  # it's optional but supported 
    backend='tpu',  # default backed is set to cpu so you must define you want to use tpu cpu or gpu
    max_length=max_length,  # Note that you have to change this in the model config too
    gradient_checkpointing='nothing_saveable',
    sharding_array=(1, -1, 1),  # the way to shard model across gpu,cpu or TPUs using sharding array (1, -1, 1)
    # everything training will be in fully fsdp automatic and share data between devices
    use_pjit_attention_force=False,
    extra_configs=conf,
    remove_ckpt_after_load=True,
    gradient_accumulation_steps=8
)
dataset = load_dataset('TRAIN_DATASET')
dataset_train = dataset['train']
dataset_eval = dataset['eval']

trainer = CausalLMTrainer(train_args,
                          dataset_train,
                          ckpt_path='flax_param_easydel')
model_and_extra_outputs = trainer.train()
print(f'Hey ! , here\'s where your model saved {model_and_extra_outputs.last_save_file_name}')


```

you can then convert it to pytorch for better use I don't recommend jax/flax for hosting models since
pytorch is better option for gpus

## Usage

To use EasyDeL in your project, you will need to import the library in your Python script and use its various functions
and classes. Here is an example of how to import EasyDeL and use its Model class:

```python

from EasyDel import FlaxLlamaForCausalLM, LlamaConfig

config = LlamaConfig.from_pretrained('owner/repo_id')
# in case building from config
model = FlaxLlamaForCausalLM(
    config=config,
    _do_init=True,  # To init Params (doing this manual is a better idea)
)

# in case of loading
```

or simply just load a params

```python
# fjutils is an inside library for EasyDeL
from fjutils.utils import read_ckpt

params = read_ckpt('path_to_ckpt_(ostFormat,EasyDeLFormat,EasyLMFormat)',
                   shard_fns=None  # shard fns in case to use with pjit to shard model
                   )

```

or loading with train state just like

```python
from fjutils import StreamingCheckpointer

ckpt_s = StreamingCheckpointer(
    StreamingCheckpointer.get_default_config(),
    'ckpt_dir'
)
train_state, params = ckpt_s.load_checkpoint(
    'params::path_to_ckpt_(ostFormat,EasyDeLFormat,EasyLMFormat)'
)
```
