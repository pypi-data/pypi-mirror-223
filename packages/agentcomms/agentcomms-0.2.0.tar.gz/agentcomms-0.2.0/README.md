[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/agentcomms.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/agentcomms)

# Installation

```bash
pip install agentcomms
```

## Quickstart

1. **Start the server**:
   You can start the server with uvicorn like this:

```python
import os

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run("agentcomms:start_server", host="0.0.0.0", port=int(os.getenv("PORT", 8000)))
```

This will start the server at `http://localhost:8000`.

2. **Get a file**:
   Once the server is up and running, you can retrieve file content by sending a GET request to `/file/{path}` endpoint, where `{path}` is the path to the file relative to the server's current storage directory.

```python
from agentcomms import get_file

# Fetches the content of the file located at "./files/test.txt"
file_content = get_file("test.txt")
print(file_content)
```

3. **Save a file**:
   Similarly, you can save content to a file by sending a POST request to `/file/` endpoint, with JSON data containing the `path` and `content` parameters.

```python
from agentcomms import add_file

# Creates a file named "test.txt" in the current storage directory
# and writes "Hello, world!" to it.
add_file("test.txt", "Hello, world!")
```
