def cache_to_file(file_path: str = "cache.pickle"):
    """
    A decorator that caches the output of a function to a file and returns the cached output if the function is called again
    with the same arguments.

    Parameters:
    file_path (str): The path to the file where the cache is stored.

    Returns:
    A decorated function that wraps the original function with caching functionality.

    Examples:
    >>> @cache_to_file('cache.pickle')
    ... def expensive_function(arg):
    ...     # Calculate the result here
    ...     return result

    Notes:
    This wrapper function uses a decorator function that takes the cache file path as an argument and returns another
    decorator function that takes the function to be cached as an argument. The inner decorator function returns a wrapper
    function that checks the cache file for the result of the function call and returns it if it's already in the cache.
    If the result is not in the cache, the wrapper calls the original function to calculate the result, stores the result
    in the cache file, and returns the result.

    The `key` variable in the wrapper function is a hashable tuple that combines the positional and keyword arguments of the
    function call into a single value that can be used as a key for the cache dictionary. The `try` block in the wrapper
    function attempts to load the cache from the file, but if the file is not found or cannot be parsed, it creates
    an empty cache instead.
