## üåê **Overview** 
***

This project aims to apply MLOps techniques to deploy a machine learning model through an API constructed with FastAPI. We utilize Poetry for dependency management and Docker for containerization, ensuring the code is modular, organized üìê, and maintainable üõ†Ô∏è. Furthermore, this project boasts comprehensive documentation üìÑ, ensuring clarity and ease of replication for other developers.

### Key Tasks üîë:

-   Code Modularization and Refactoring: The original script needed an overhaul to reach a modular, and potentially object-oriented, structure üîÑ.

-   Documentation: Implementing clear and concise documentation üìö to ensure smooth navigation and comprehension for fellow developers.

-   Preservation of Output: Despite alterations in the code's structure and logic, the model's predictions (output) ought to remain consistent ‚úîÔ∏è.

-   Configuration File Modification: The structure of `artifacts/pipeline.jsonc` was amenable to changes to ensure it meshed seamlessly with the revamped code structure üîß.

-   Incorporate TODOs: The code housed multiple TODOs that had to be addressed and realized as part of the challenge üìù.

-   Scalability Consideration: The reshaped code was anticipated to cater to hefty data scenarios, suggesting that the supplied sample data file might, in a real-world setting, symbolize a table spanning several gigabytes in a data lake üìä.

### Constraints and Considerations üö´:

-   The generated code should be portable and capable of executing flawlessly in an alternate Python environment üêç.

-   The provided "pickle" files were crafted using Python version 3.8.13 and Scikit-learn version 1.0.2. Though other libraries might be pivotal for diverse facets of the project, these particular versions were indispensable for the "pickle" files üìå.

-   Intricate or time-intensive modifications, if not instantly implementable, should be signposted within the code as TODOs. These markers should also sketch out the strategic approach intended for their eventual fulfillment üï∞Ô∏è.
