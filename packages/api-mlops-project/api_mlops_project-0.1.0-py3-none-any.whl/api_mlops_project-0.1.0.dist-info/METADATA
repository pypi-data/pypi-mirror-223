## 🌐 **Overview** 
***

This project aims to apply MLOps techniques to deploy a machine learning model through an API constructed with FastAPI. We utilize Poetry for dependency management and Docker for containerization, ensuring the code is modular, organized 📐, and maintainable 🛠️. Furthermore, this project boasts comprehensive documentation 📄, ensuring clarity and ease of replication for other developers.

### Key Tasks 🔑:

-   Code Modularization and Refactoring: The original script needed an overhaul to reach a modular, and potentially object-oriented, structure 🔄.

-   Documentation: Implementing clear and concise documentation 📚 to ensure smooth navigation and comprehension for fellow developers.

-   Preservation of Output: Despite alterations in the code's structure and logic, the model's predictions (output) ought to remain consistent ✔️.

-   Configuration File Modification: The structure of `artifacts/pipeline.jsonc` was amenable to changes to ensure it meshed seamlessly with the revamped code structure 🔧.

-   Incorporate TODOs: The code housed multiple TODOs that had to be addressed and realized as part of the challenge 📝.

-   Scalability Consideration: The reshaped code was anticipated to cater to hefty data scenarios, suggesting that the supplied sample data file might, in a real-world setting, symbolize a table spanning several gigabytes in a data lake 📊.

### Constraints and Considerations 🚫:

-   The generated code should be portable and capable of executing flawlessly in an alternate Python environment 🐍.

-   The provided "pickle" files were crafted using Python version 3.8.13 and Scikit-learn version 1.0.2. Though other libraries might be pivotal for diverse facets of the project, these particular versions were indispensable for the "pickle" files 📌.

-   Intricate or time-intensive modifications, if not instantly implementable, should be signposted within the code as TODOs. These markers should also sketch out the strategic approach intended for their eventual fulfillment 🕰️.

##  📝 **Next Steps**
***

Here are some next steps that can be implemented in the future:

### 1️⃣ Model Registration in MLflow

Lastly, to track and manage our machine learning model iterations, we will use [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) to register, version, and share models.


### 2️⃣ Validation with Stakeholders

We plan to conduct several feedback sessions with our stakeholders to ensure the project aligns with the expectations and needs of the end users.

### 3️⃣ Monitoring Setup

Monitoring the performance and functionality of the system is crucial to ensure its reliability and efficiency. It's important to implement tools and processes for keeping an eye on the system.

### 4️⃣ Alert Setup for Slack or Email

To ensure a swift response to any issues that may arise, we'll implement alerts that will send notifications to Slack or predetermined emails in case of system failures.

### 5️⃣ Refactoring of the `dataframe_checker.py` class

Currently, the `dataframe_checker.py` class is responsible for validating input data. Initially, it wasn't built with PySpark, but ideally, its internal logic should be replaced with [PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/index.html) to optimize validation and preparation of data on large datasets.

### 6️⃣ Scheduling with Airflow
