# This package is moving to the aeon-toolkit.
Starting from v0.3.0, this package will not be updated, bugfixes will still be included if issues are raised.
You can already find RDST in the Aeon package at https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/ . Further improvements are planned for further speeding up RDST, these improvement will only be implemented in aeon.
All the functionnalities of this package will be ported into Aeon when I got some time, for now, only the transformer for univariate and multivariate series of even length have been implemented.

# Readme
Welcome to the convst repository. It contains the implementation of the `Random Dilated Shapelet Transform (RDST)` along with other works in the same area.

## Installation

The recommended way to install the latest stable version is to use pip with `pip install convst`. To install the package from sources, you can download the latest version on GitHub and run `python setup.py install`. This should install the package and automatically look for the dependencies using `pip`. 

We recommend doing this in a new virtual environment using anaconda to avoid any conflict with an existing installation. If you wish to install dependencies individually, you can see dependencies in the `setup.py` file.

An optional dependency that can help speed up numba, which is used in our implementation, is the Intel vector math library (SVML). When using conda it can be installed by running `conda install -c numba icc_rt`. I didn't test the behavior with AMD processors, but I suspect it won't work.

## Tutorial
We give here a minimal example to run the `RDST` algorithm on any dataset of the UCR archive using the aeon API to get datasets:

```python

from convst.classifiers import R_DST_Ridge
from convst.utils.dataset_utils import load_UCR_UEA_dataset_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, _ = load_UCR_UEA_dataset_split('GunPoint')

# First run may be slow due to numba compilations on the first call. 
# Run a small dataset like GunPoint if this is the first time you call RDST on your system.
# You can change n_shapelets to 1 to make this process faster. The n_jobs parameter can
# also be changed to increase speed once numba compilation are done.

rdst = R_DST_Ridge(n_shapelets=10_000, n_jobs=1).fit(X_train, y_train)
print("Accuracy Score for RDST : {}".format(rdst.score(X_test, y_test)))
```
If you want a more powerful model, you can use R_DST_Ensemble as follows (note that additional Numba compilation might be needed here):
```python

from convst.classifiers import R_DST_Ensemble

rdst_e = R_DST_Ensemble(
  n_shapelets_per_estimator=10_000,
  n_jobs=1
).fit(X_train, y_train)
print("Accuracy Score for RDST : {}".format(rdst_e.score(X_test, y_test)))

```
You can obtain faster result by using more jobs and even faster, at the expense of some accuracy, with the prime_dilation option:

```python
rdst_e = R_DST_Ensemble(
  n_shapelets_per_estimator=10_000,
  prime_dilations=True,
  n_jobs=-1
).fit(X_train, y_train)

print("Accuracy Score for RDST : {}".format(rdst_e.score(X_test, y_test)))
```
You can also visualize a shapelet using the visualization tool to obtain such visualization :

To know more about all the interpretability tools, check the documentation on readthedocs.

## Supported inputs
RDST support the following type of time series:
- Univariate and same length
- Univariate and variable length
- Multivariate and same length
- Multivariate and variable length

We use the standard scikit-learn interface and expect as input a 3D numpy array of shape `(n_samples, n_features, n_timestamps)`. For variable length input, we expect a (python) list of numpy arrays, or a numpy array with object dtype.

## Reproducing the paper results

Multiple scripts are available under the `PaperScripts` folder. It contains the exact same scripts used to generate our results, notably the `test_models.py` file, used to generate the csv results available in the `Results` folder of the archive.

abstract="Shapelet-based algorithms are widely used for time series classification because of their ease of interpretation, but they are currently outperformed by recent state-of-the-art approaches. We present a new formulation of time series shapelets including the notion of dilation, and we introduce a new shapelet feature to enhance their discriminative power for classification. Experiments performed on 112 datasets show that our method improves on the state-of-the-art shapelet algorithm, and achieves comparable accuracy to recent state-of-the-art approaches, without sacrificing neither scalability, nor interpretability.",

## TODO for relase 1.0:

- [ ] Finish Numpy docs in all python files
- [ ] Update documentation and examples
- [X] Enhance interface for interpretability tools
- [X] Add the Generalised version of RDST
- [ ] Continue unit tests and code coverage/quality
