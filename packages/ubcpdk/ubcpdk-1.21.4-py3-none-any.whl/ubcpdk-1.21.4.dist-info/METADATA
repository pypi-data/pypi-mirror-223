SiEPIC Ebeam PDK adapted from [siepic Ebeam PDK](https://github.com/lukasc-ubc/SiEPIC_EBeam_PDK) for gdsfactory.
It provides a fully python driven flow alternative for the most advanced users taking the [edx course](https://www.edx.org/course/silicon-photonics-design-fabrication-and-data-ana)

## Installation

If you don't have python installed on your system you can [download the gdsfactory installer](https://github.com/gdsfactory/gdsfactory/releases) with python3, miniconda and all gdsfactory plugins.

### Installation for new gdsfactory users

Use python3.10 or python3.11, as some tools like kfactory are not available for older versions of python. We recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as an IDE.

If you don't have python installed on your system you can [download anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

Once you have python installed, open Anaconda Prompt as Administrator and then install the latest gdsfactory using pip.

```
pip install ubcpdk --upgrade
```

Then you need to restart Klayout to make sure the new technology installed appears.

### Installation for developers

For developers you need to `git clone` the GitHub repository, fork it, git add, git commit, git push and merge request your changes.

```
git clone https://github.com/gdsfactory/ubc.git
cd ubc
pip install -e . pre-commit
pre-commit install
python install_tech.py
```
