            <h3 id="toc_1.1">What and why is Not1MM</h3>

            <p>Not1MM&#39;s interface is a blantent ripoff of N1MM.
                It is NOT N1MM and any problem you have with this software should in no way reflect on their software.
            </p>

            <p>If you use Windows(tm) you should run away from this and use someother program.</p>

            <p>I personally don&#39;t. While it may be possible to get N1MM working under Wine, I haven&#39;t checked,
                I&#39;d rather not have to jump thru the hoops.</p>

            <p><strong>Currently this exists for my own personal amusement</strong>.
                Something to do in my free time.
                While I&#39;m not watching TV, Right vs Left political &#39;News&#39; programs, mind numbing
                &#39;Reality&#39; TV etc...</p>

            <h3 id="toc_1.2">Current state</h3>

            <p>The current state is <q><strong>BETA</strong></q>. I&#39;ve used it for A few contests, and was able to
                work contacts and submit a cabrillo at the end. I&#39;m not a <q>Contester</q>. So I&#39;ll add contests
                as/if I work them. I&#39;m only one guy, so if you see a bug let me know. I don&#39;t do much of any
                Data or RTTY operating. This is why you don&#39;t see RTTY in the list of working contests. The Lord
                helps those who burn people at the... I mean who help themselves. Feel free to fill in that hole with a
                pull request.</p>

            <h4 id="toc_1.7.1">Dark mode on Ubuntu</h4>

            <p>I believe I figured out dark mode in Ubuntu and have it working on my shack PC that runs Ubuntu 22.04.
                The secret sauce seems to be installing adwaita-qt with apt, and setting an environment variable
                <code>QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE</code> to <code>Adwaita-Dark</code>. I set the environment variable in the start
                of the program if running on a Gnome platform. So you don&#39;t need to do that part.</p>

            <h3 id="toc_1.8">Wayland Compositor</h3>

            <p>One side effect of Wayland is that we are not able to request for a window to regain or retain focus. So
                if you were to click on a spot in the bandmap window to tune to that spot, you would have to then click
                on the main window to continue entering contest data. I&#39;m aware of this, but i can not change it.
            </p>

            <h3 id="toc_1.10">Various data file locations</h3>

            <h4 id="toc_1.10.1">Data</h4>

            <p>If your system has an <code>XDG_DATA_HOME</code> environment variable set, the database and CW macro
                files can be found there. Otherwise they will be found at <code>yourhome/.local/share/not1mm</code></p>

            <h4 id="toc_1.10.2">Config</h4>

            <p>Configuration file(s) can be found at the location defined by <code>XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code>. Otherwise
                they will be found at <code>yourhome/.config/not1mm</code></p>

            <h3 id="toc_1.11">The database</h3>

            <h4 id="toc_1.11.1">Why</h4>

            <p>The database holds... wait for it... data... I know shocker right. A database can hold one or many
                contest logs. It also holds the station information, everything shown in the Station Settings dialog.
                You can have one database for the rest of your life. Filled with hundreds of contests you&#39;ve logged.
                Or, you can create a new database to hold just one contest. You do You Boo.</p>

            <h4 id="toc_1.11.2">The first one</h4>

            <p>On the initial running, a database is created for you called <code>ham.db</code>. This, and all future
                databases, are located in the data directory mentioned above.</p>

            <h4 id="toc_1.11.3">Why limit yourself</h4>

            <p>You can create a new database by selecting <code>File</code> &gt; <code>New Database</code> from the main
                window, and give it a snazzy name. Why limit yourself. Hell, create one every day for all I care. You
                can manage your own digital disaster.</p>

            <h4 id="toc_1.11.4">Revisiting an old friend</h4>

            <p>You can select a previously created databases for use by selecting <code>File</code> &gt;
                <code>Open Database</code>.</p>

            <h3 id="toc_1.12">Station Settings dialog (REQUIRED)</h3>

            <p>After initial run of the program or creating a new database you will need to fill out the Station
                Settings dialog that will pop up.</p>

            <p>You can fill it out if you want to. You can leave our friends behind. &#39;Cause your friends don&#39;t
                fill, and if they don&#39;t fill. Well, they&#39;re no friends of mine.</p>

            <p>You can fill. You can fill. Everyone look at your keys.</p>

            <h4 id="toc_1.16.1">Lookup</h4>

            <p>For callsign lookup, Two services are supported. QRZ and HamQTH. They require a username and password,
                Enter it here.</p>

            <h4 id="toc_1.16.2">Soundcard</h4>

            <p>Choose the sound output device for the voice keyer.</p>

            <h4 id="toc_1.16.3">CAT</h4>

            <p>Under the <code>CAT</code> TAB, you can choose either <code>rigctld</code> normally with an IP of
                <code>127.0.0.1</code> and a port of <code>4532</code>. Or <code>flrig</code>, IP normally of
                <code>127.0.0.1</code> and a port of <code>12345</code>. <code>None</code> is always an option, but is
                it really?</p>

            <h4 id="toc_1.16.4">CW Keyer interface</h4>

            <p>Under the <code>CW</code> TAB, There are three options. <code>cwdaemon</code>, which normally uses IP
                <code>127.0.0.1</code> and port <code>6789</code>. <code>pywinkeyer</code> which normally uses IP
                <code>127.0.0.1</code> and port <code>8000</code>. Or <code>None</code>, if you want to Morse it like
                it&#39;s 1899.</p>

                used for the bandmap window.</p>

            <h4 id="toc_1.16.6">N1MM Packets</h4>

            <p>Work has started on N1MM udp packets. So far just RadioInfo, contactinfo, contactreplace and
                contactdelete.</p>

            <p>When entering IP and Ports, enter them with a colon &#39;:&#39; between them. You can enter multiple
                pairs on the same line if separated by a space &#39; &#39;.</p>

            <h3 id="toc_1.17">Hiding screen elements</h3>

            <p>You can show or hide certain buttons/indicators by checking and unchecking their boxes under the view
                menu. You can then resize the screen to make it more compact.</p>

            <p>The your choices will be remembered when you relaunch the program.</p>

            <h3 id="toc_1.18">Editing macro keys</h3>

            <p>To edit the macros, choose <code>File</code> &gt; <code>Edit Macros</code>. This will open your systems
                registered text editor with current macros loaded. When your done just save the file and close the
                editor. The file loaded to edit, CW or SSB, will be determined by your current operating mode.</p>

            <p>After editing and saving the macro file. You can force the logger to reload the macro file by toggeling
                between <code>Run</code> and <code>S&amp;P</code> states.</p>

            <h4 id="toc_1.18.1">Macro substitutions</h4>

            <p>You can include a limited set of substitution instructions.</p>

            <ul dir="auto">
                <li>{MYCALL} Sends the station call.</li>
                <li>{HISCALL} Send what&#39;s in the callsign field.</li>
                <li>{SNT} Sends 5nn (cw) or 599 (ssb)</li>
                <li>{SENTNR} Sends whats in the SentNR field.</li>
                <li>{EXCH} Sends what&#39;s in the Sent Exchange field when contest is defined.</li>
                <li>&#39;#&#39; Sends serial number.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 id="toc_1.18.2">Macro use with voice</h4>

            <p>The macros when used with voice, will also accept filenames of WAV files to play, excluding the file
                extension. The filename must be enclosed by brackets. For example <code>[CQ]</code> will play
                <code>cq.wav</code>, <code>[again]</code> will play <code>again.wav</code>. The wav files are stored in
                the operators personal data directory. The filenames must be in lowercase. See <a
                    href="#various-data-file-locations">Various data file locations</a> above for the location of your
                data files. For me, the macro <code>[cq]</code> will play
                <code>/home/mbridak/.local/share/not1mm/K6GTE/cq.wav</code></p>

            <p><strong>The current wav files in place are not the ones you will want to use. They sound like an
                    idiot.</strong> You can use something like Audacity to record new wav files in your own voice.</p>

            <p>Aside from the <code>[filename]</code> wav files, there are also NATO phonetic wav files for each letter
                and number. So if your macro key holds <code>{HISCALL} {SNT} {SENTNR}</code> and you have entered K5TUX
                in callsign field during CQ WW SSB while in CQ Zone 3. You&#39;ll here Kilo 5 Tango Uniform X-ray, 5 9
                9, 3. Hopefully not in an idiots voice.</p>

            <h3 id="toc_1.19">cty.dat and QRZ lookups for distance and bearing</h3>

            <p>When a callsign is entered, a look up is first done in a cty.dat file to determin the country of origin,
                geographic center, cq zone and ITU region. Great circle calculations are done to determin the heading
                and distance from your gridsquare to the grographic center. This information then displayed at the
                bottom left.</p>

            <p>After this, a request is made to QRZ for the gridsquare of the callsign. If there is a response the
                information is recalculated and displayed. You&#39;ll know is this has happened, since the gridsquare
                will replace the word <q>Regional</q>.</p>

            <h3 id="toc_1.20">Other uses for the call field</h3>

            <ul dir="auto">
                <li>[A Frequency] You can enter a frequency in kilohertz. This will change the band you&#39;re logging
                    on. If you have CAT control, this will change the frequency of the radio as well.</li>
                <li>[CW, SSB, RTTY] You can set the mode logged. If you have CAT control this will also change the mode
                    on the radio.</li>
                <li>[OPON] Change the operator currently logging.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>You must press the SPACE bar after entering any of the above.</strong></p>

            <p>The Log display gets updated automatically when a contact is entered. The top half is a list of all
                contacts.</p>

            <p>The bottom half of the log displays contacts sorted by what&#39;s currently in the call entry field. The
                columns displayed in the log window are dependant on what contests is currently active.</p>

            <h5 id="toc_1.21.2.4">Editing a contact</h5>

            <p>You can double click a cell in the log window and edit its contents.</p>

            <p>You can also Right-Click on a cell to bring up the edit dialog.</p>

            <p>You can not directly edit the multiplier status of a contact. Instead see the next section on
                recalculating mults. If you change the callsign make sure the <code>WPX</code> field is still valid.</p>

            <h3 id="toc_1.22">Recalulate Mults</h3>

            <p>After editing a contact and before generating a Cabrillo file. There is a Misc menu option that will

            <p>The bandmap window is, as with everything, a work in progress. The bandmap now follows the VFO. VFO
                indicator now displays as small triangle in the frequency tickmarks. A small blue rectangle shows the
                receivers bandwidth. Clicked on spots now tune the radio and set the callsign field.</p>

            <h3 id="toc_1.26">Contest specific notes</h3>

            <p>I found it might be beneficial to have a section devoted to wierd quirky things about operating a
                specific contests.</p>

            <h4 id="toc_1.26.1">ARRL Sweekstakes</h4>

            <h5 id="toc_1.26.1.4">The exchange parser</h5>

            <p>This was a pain in the tukus. There are so many elements to the exchange, and one input field aside from
                the callsign field. So I had to write sort of a &#39;parser&#39;. The parser moves over your input
                string following some basic rules and is re-evaluated with each keypress and the parsed result will be
                displayed in the label over the field. The exchange looks like <code>124 A K6GTE 17 ORG</code>, a Serial
                number, Precidence, Callsign, Year Licenced and Section. even though the callsign is given as part of
                the exchange, the callsign does not have to be entered and is pulled from the callsign field. If the
                exchange was entered as <code>124 A 17 ORG</code> you would see:</p>

            <p>You can enter the serial number and precidence, or the year and section as pairs. For instance
                <code>124A 17ORG</code>. This would ensure the values get parsed correctly.</p>

            <p>You do not have to go back to correct typing. You can just tack the correct items to the end of the field
                and the older values will get overwritten. So if you entered <code>124A 17ORG Q</code>, the precidence
                will change from A to Q. If you need to change the serial number you must append the precidence to it,
                <code>125A</code>.</p>

            <p>If the callsign was entered wrong in the callsign field, you can put the correct callsign some where in
                the exchange. As long as it shows up in the parsed label above correctly your good.</p>

            <p>The best thing you can do is play around with it to see how it behaves.</p>
