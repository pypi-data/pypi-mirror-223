# Superconducting Circuit Builder
This is a GUI for designing superconducting circuits intended to accompany the Python package scQubits.

## Installation
* git clone https://github.com/benmcdonough20/CircuitBuilder.git
* pip install pyside2

## Usage
Start by running `python circuitbuilder.py`. The elements used to build a circuit are
1) Capacitor
2) Inductor
3) Josephson Junction

Drag the icons from the toolbox onto the canvas to place down an element. Drag nodes together to connect them. Left-click on wires to add anchor points and drag 
the anchor points to guide the wires.

### Keyboard
* `Shift + Right Click` - add to selection
* `Shift + Right Drag` - add box to selection
* `Enter` on property entry box - change property

### Mouse
* `Left Button Drag` on whitespace - pan
* `Scroll Wheel` - zoom
* `Left Button Drag` on element/selected group - move selection
* `Right Button Drag` - box selection
* `Left Button Click` on element - rotate
* `Right Button Click` on element - select and show properties

## Features
* Split (reverse-join) nodes
* Delete elements
* Wire anchor points
* Undo / Redo
* Save / Open
* Export to scQubits circuit format
* Pre-made circuit library

## Dependencies
* Python 3.10.8
* PySide2 5.15.8
* Numpy 1.22.4

## Known issues
There are still many bugs!
* Right click has no activation distance, so using a mouse will result in some dropped right clicks
* Sometime import/undo/redo (the memento-based functionalities) crash, but usually they seem to work
