Provides differentiable ("relaxed") versions of common operations in high-energy physics.

Based on [`jax`](http://github.com/google/jax). Where possible, function APIs try to mimic their
commonly used counterparts, e.g. fitting and hypothesis testing in
[`pyhf`](http://github.com/scikit-hep/pyhf).

## Currently implemented:

- **[basic operations](src/relaxed/ops.py)**:
  - `relaxed.hist`: histograms via kernel density estimation (tunable bandwidth).
  - `relaxed.cut`: approximates a hard cut with a sigmoid function (tunable slope).
- **[fitting routines](src/relaxed/mle.py)**:
  - `relaxed.mle.fit`: global MLE fit.
  - `relaxed.mle.fixed_poi_fit`: constrained fit given a value of a parameter of interest.
- **[inference](src/relaxed/infer.py)**:
  - `relaxed.infer.hypotest`: hypothesis test based on the profile likelihood. Supports test
    statistics for both limit setting (`q`) and discovery (`q_0`).
  - `relaxed.fisher_info`: the fisher information matrix (of a `pyhf`-type model).
  - `relaxed.cramer_rao_uncert`: inverts the fisher information matrix to provide uncertainties
    valid through the
    [Cramér-Rao bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cram%C3%A9r%E2%80%93Rao_bound).
- **[metrics](src/relaxed/metrics.py)**:
  - `relaxed.metrics.gaussianity`: an experimental metric that quantifies the mean-squared
    difference of a likelihood function with respect to its gaussian approximation (covariance
    calculated using the Cramér-Rao bound above).
  - `relaxed.metrics.asimov_sig`: easy access to the (single- and multi-bin) stat-only expected
    significance.

We're maintaining a list of desired differentiable operations in
[`list_of_operations.md`](list_of_operations.md) (thanks to [@cranmer](http://github.com/cranmer))
-- feel free to take inspiration or contribute with a PR if there's one you can handle :)

## Install

In your virtual environment:

```
python3 -m pip install relaxed
```

## Examples

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/gradhep/relaxed/main?labpath=examples%2Fcuts.ipynb)
<- Click here to start playing with our examples straight away (thanks to Binder)!

If you'd rather run the example notebooks locally from `examples/`, you can clone the repository,
then:

```
python3 -m venv venv  # or virtualenv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install relaxed
cd examples
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then launch jupyter through your preferred medium (vscode, jupyterlab, etc.), making sure to use
this virtual env as your kernel (e.g. you can `pip` install and run jupyter lab in this env).

## Sharp bits

For serious use with `pyhf`, e.g. in a [`neos`](http://github.com/gradhep/neos)-type workflow, it is
temporarily recommended to install `pyhf` using a specific branch that is designed to be
differentiable with respect to model construction:

```
python3 -m pip install git+http://github.com/scikit-hep/pyhf.git@make_difffable_model_ctor
```

We plan to merge this into `pyhf` when it's stable, and will then drop this instruction :)

## Cite

If you use `relaxed`, please cite us! You should be able to do that from the github UI (top-right,
under 'cite this repository'), but if not, see our
[Zenodo DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/264991846) or our [`CITATION.cff`](CITATION.cff).

## Acknowledgments

Big thanks to all the developers of the main packages we use (`jax`, `pyhf`, `jaxopt`). Thanks also
to [@dfm](github.com/user/dfm) for the README header inspiration ;)
