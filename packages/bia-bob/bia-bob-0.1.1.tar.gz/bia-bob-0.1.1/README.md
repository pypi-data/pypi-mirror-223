# bia-bob

BIA Bob is a Jupyter-based assistant for interacting with image data and for working on Bio-image Analysis tasks.
It is based on [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction.html) and [OpenAI's API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api). You need an openai API account to use it.
