# multiHGtest -- Testing for differences in survival using multiple hypergeometric P-values. 

This packages implements the test for survival data described in 
[1] Galili, Kipnis and Yakini. Survival analysis with sensitivity to possible rare and weak differences. 2023. 


## Methods
``hypergeom_test``      Exact hypergeometric test
``HCHGtest``            Use higher criticism of hypergeometric P-values to test the significant 
``FisherHGtest``        Fisher combination test of hypergeometric P-values
``testHG_dashboard``    Illustrates statistics associated with the HG P-values
