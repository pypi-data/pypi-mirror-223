# Facialis Palsy File Models

## Introduction

There exist some Grading Systems for Facial Palsy. These Gradings are mostly saved in own developed File Formats. 
This Repository trys to define a standardised file format for the most common grading systems.

## File Format

The File Format is based on the [JSON](https://www.json.org/) Format.
This library implements a pydantic base model for the JSON Format definition and parsing.

## Models

### Sunnybrook

The Sunnybrook Grading System is defined in the [Sunnybrook Facial Grading System: Reliability and Criteria for Nasolabial Fold]() Paper.

The Model is defined in the `facialis_palsy.models.sunnybrook` Module.

### House Brackmann

The Sunnybrook Grading System is defined in:

*House, J.W., Brackmann, D.E. Facial nerve grading system. Otolaryngol. Head Neck Surg, \[93\] 146â€“147. 1985.*

The Model is defined in the `facialis_palsy.models.house_brackmann` Module.

**Grade I - Normal**

> Normal facial function in all areas
 
**Grade II - Slight Dysfunction**

> Gross: slight weakness noticeable on close inspection; may have very slight synkinesis
> At rest: normal symmetry and tone
> Motion: forehead - moderate to good function; eye - complete closure with minimum effort; mouth - slight asymmetry.
 
**Grade III - Moderate Dysfunction**

> Gross: obvious but not disfiguring difference between two sides; noticeable but not severe synkinesis, contracture, and/or hemi-facial spasm.
> At rest: normal symmetry and tone
> Motion: forehead - slight to moderate movement; eye - complete closure with effort; mouth - slightly weak with maximum effort.
 
**Grade IV - Moderate Severe Dysfunction**

> Gross: obvious weakness and/or disfiguring asymmetry
> At rest: normal symmetry and tone
> Motion: forehead - none; eye - incomplete closure; mouth - asymmetric with maximum effort.
 
**Grade V - Severe Dysfunction**

> Gross: only barely perceptible motion
> At rest: asymmetry
> Motion: forehead - none; eye - incomplete closure; mouth - slight movement
 
**Grade VI - Total Paralysis**

> No movement

### Yanagihara

The Yanagihara Grading System is defined in the [Yanagihara Grading System for Facial Palsy]() Paper.

The Model is defined in the `facialis_palsy.models.yanagihara` Module.

### eFACE

The eFACE Grading System is defined in the [eFACE: A New Clinical Tool to Evaluate Facial Function](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3880122/) Paper.

The Model is defined in the `facialis_palsy.models.eface` Module.

## Additional Metadata

We define some additional Metadata for the File Format.

```
metadata_version_number: "0.0.0"
application_version: str = "APPLICATION_VERSION"
application_org: str = "ORGANIZATION_DOMAIN"
```

The metadata_version_number gets updated via python `change_version_number.py` script. 
This script updates the version number in all files accordingly to the `setup.py`.

The application_version and application_org are specific to the application which uses this library and writes the files.
