## Typing stubs for Pygments

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `Pygments` package. It
can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`Pygments`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/Pygments. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

This stub package is marked as [partial](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/#partial-stub-packages).
If you find that annotations are missing, feel free to contribute and help complete them.


See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `e787a88f59ca482d97a426e6ddd1aba140dd01d6` and was tested
with mypy 1.4.1, pyright 1.1.319, and
pytype 2023.7.21.
