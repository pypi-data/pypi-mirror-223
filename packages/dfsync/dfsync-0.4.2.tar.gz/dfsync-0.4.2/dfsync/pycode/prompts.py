Please explain the byte pair encoding (BPE) text tokenisation algorithm used in large language models like GPT2 and GPT3. Here is a python function that produces the list of merges required for tokenization:
```
def regular_bpe(body_words, vocab_size=60):
    word_freqs = get_word_frequency(body_words)
    vocab = get_alphabet(word_freqs.keys())
    splits = {word: [c for c in word] for word in word_freqs.keys()}

    merges = {}
    while len(vocab) < vocab_size:
        pair_freqs = get_pair_freqs(word_freqs, splits)
        best_pair, freq = get_max_freq_item(pair_freqs)
        splits = merge_pair(*best_pair, splits, word_freqs)

        new_item = best_pair[0] + best_pair[1]
        merges[best_pair] = new_item
        vocab.append(new_item)

    return merges
```

This algorithm has the following drawback: the phrases "The water is hot." and "The water is not hot." have opposite meanings but are tokenised to very similar vectors. Propose a tweak to the BPE algorithm that fixes this drawback and makes the vectors for the phrases "The water is not hot." and "The water is cold." more cosine-similar. Consequently this tweaked BPE should make the vectors for "The water is hot." and "The water is not hot." very dissimilar. Think of two's complement binary representation for integer numbers, where the representation for 1 and -1 are bit-by-bit different. If such a modification isn't possible or does not make sense, explain it.


Show me how "The water is not hot." and "The water is cold." would be more similar with this modified_bpe algorithm.





You are a helpful assistant trained on lots of expert python code annotated with code design quality assessments written by Guido van Rossum, the creator of python and an expert at evaluating high level code quality and source code design.

Given the following python code, analyse all of it.

```
# Python source file name: utils.py

    import re, urllib.parse

    pattern = "^https:\/\/[0-9A-z.\-]+.[0-9A-z.\-]+.[a-z]+$"
    result = re.match(pattern, url)
    if not result:
