# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We only support the latest version.

We are following [*CalVer*](https://calver.org) with generous backwards-compatibility guarantees.
Therefore we only support the latest version.

That said, you shouldn't be afraid to upgrade if you're only using our documented public APIs and pay attention to `DeprecationWarning`s.
Whenever there is a need to break compatibility, it is announced in the changelog and raises a `DeprecationWarning` for a year (if possible) before it's finally really broken.
