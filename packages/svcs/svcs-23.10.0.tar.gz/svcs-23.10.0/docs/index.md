# *svcs*: A Lightweight Service Locator

Release **{sub-ref}`release`**  ([What's new?](changelog))

::: {admonition} ☠️ Not ready yet! ☠️
:class: danger

This project is only public to [gather feedback](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/discussions), and everything can and will change until the project is proclaimed stable.

The code has 100% test and type coverage, and the shipped *Flask* and *Pyramid* integrations have been in production for years, but the API details can still change.
