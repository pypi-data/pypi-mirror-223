           Every person needs a personal e-mail address. This address must be one
           that you, the participating child, check and read yourself, not one owned by your
           parents.

           If you do not have a personal e-mail address yet, and do not want or cannot register
           one with one of the "big" providers (keep in mind that Google, Outlook, etc. are
           allowed from 16 years only, and often collect and analyse your private mail), you can
           register an e-mail address with us.

         You will be asked for your existing, personal e-mail address. Please remember
         that you should not use an address owned by your parents. If you do not have
         a personal e-mail address, please choose the respective option instead!
