           Welcome to the registration for this event! Please make sure to fill in
           the registration yourself, as the child who wants to participate.
           You should fill in the registration together with a parent (or other legal
           guardian).

           We ask parents to not fill in the registration on behalf of their child.
           It is a requirement that our participants can freely access and
           manage their accounts and inboxes, and that parents allow their
           children to keep their passwords secret. We kindly ask parents to
           get in contact with us if they have questions about this rule,
           and of course, we encourage all children to show everything they
           do not understand or have questions about to their parents.

           Every participant needs a personal e-mail address. This address must be one
           that you, the participating child, check and read yourself, not one owned by your
           parents. Of course, we will always send important information to your parents as
           well, and of course you should always talk to your parents if you
           have questions or concerns while reading your e-mail.

           If you do not have a personal e-mail address yet, and do not want or cannot register
           one with one of the "big" providers (keep in mind that Google, Outlook, etc. are
           allowed from 16 years only, and often collect and analyse your private mail), you can
           register an e-mail address with us.
