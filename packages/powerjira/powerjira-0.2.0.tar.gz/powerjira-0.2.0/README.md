# **PowerJira**
*A succinct local jira control plane*

<br />

## **Welcome to PowerJira!**
Hate how visually noise and clunky the Jira web-app is? Ever wish you could just type the small subset of issue fields you actually care about into an editor and create/find tickets quickly?

Welcome to the party! ü•≥

## **Get Started üöÄ**
<hr>

To get started, clone this repo and populate the config files per the readme.

Specifically, you need 4 files. These can be named whatever you wish by editing `main.py:59`. \
Below are the requirements of the file with the default (suggested) file names:
- `summary` - Text file for the issue summary
- `description` - Text file for the issue description
- `agent.yml` - Yaml file for user credentials
- `config.yml` - Yaml file to configure issue creation

The text files simply contain the text you want in the ticket. \
As for the yaml files, see the **Usage** section below.

Set up your editor space the way you like it, and bam! You've dramatically reduced your time spent in the jira web-app, and even possibly absolve the need for it completely!

<br />

## **Usage ‚öô**
<hr>

With your shell's working directory positioned where the 4 files are present (or if paths have been set accordingly):

**Create ticket with config values**
```sh
./main.py [-r|--raw]
```
**Fetch info from existing ticket**
```sh
./main.py --fetch=<issue-key> [-r|--raw]
```
**Info**
```sh
./main.py [-h|--help]
```

The "*raw*" option flag (`-r`, `--raw`) outputs a formatted dump of the raw api response.

For your own custom use:
```python
from powerjira import fetchIssue, createTicket
```

For the configuration yaml's:
**config.yml**
```yaml
project:   <project-key>
priority:  <priority>

epicKey:   # Leave as empty for standalone task or epic
issueType: <type>

reporter:  <reporter-account-id>
assignee:  <assignee-account-id>
```
**agent.yaml**
```yaml
domain:   <host>

userName: <email>
token:    <jira-access-token>
```
