What Sorcha Does Not Handle
=================================

Here we note the effects that are not currently captured within this survey simulator. With the modular nature of the package, it should be straight forward to develop functions to handle these in the future. If you want to add any of these features into Sorcha, please check out our :ref:`Reporting Issues and Proposing Changes page<Reporting Issues and Proposing Changes>`.

Here is a short summary of the key effects not accounted for in Sorcha:

- Rotational light curves
- Changing phase curves due to changing viewing angles (impacts some inner Solar System objects)
- Stellar crowding as a function of galactic latitude
- Cometary outbursts
- YORP (Yarkovsky–O'Keefe–Radzievskii–Paddack) effect
- Non-gravitational forces
- Collisions and breakup events
