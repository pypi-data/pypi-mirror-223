        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>The Meeting Roles application is designed to manage and schedule meeting roles efficiently. It assigns roles to active persons, considering their availability and previous assignments.</p>
        <p>The algorithm operates as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>It checks the list of active persons.</li>
            <li>It selects the next persons in line for the roles, considering their previous assignments.</li>
            <li>If a person is paused, they will be skipped in the next assignment.</li>
            <li>The schedule is saved, and the information can be viewed as needed.</li>
        </ol>
