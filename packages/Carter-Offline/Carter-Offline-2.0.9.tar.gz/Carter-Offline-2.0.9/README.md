# Carter Offline

Carter Offline is an intent classifier which is based on a modified version of Janex, and utilises LazyLyrics' Carter-Py library.

It compares the input you send to your carter agent with a list of patterns in your chosen intents file, and then remembers the class. Once your Carter agent creates a response, the program saves the response to your intents, recording the interaction and improving your intents dataset.

This is based on an older version of Janex (release 0.0.5.beta, specifically), and so it may not include the latest features from there unless explicitly added in.

<h3> How to use </h3>

<h5> Adding to your project </h5>

```
python3 -m pip install Carter-Offline
```
Secondly, you need to import the library into your Python script.

```
from CarterOffline import *
```

<h4>Using Carter-Offline in your code</h4>

<h5>Define Variables</h5>

To use this program, you will need to define your API key, name and intent file path.

```
intents_file_path = "intents.json"

CarterAPI = "YOUR CARTER AGENT'S API"

input_string = "Hello!" # for example

User = "YOUR NAME"

# Create an instance of the CarterOffline class

CarterOffline = CarterOffline(intents_file_path, CarterAPI)
```

<h5>Speak to your agent</h5>

Here is the simple bit of code that sends the message to your Carter agent using the Carter-Py library, and then uses the Janex code to classify it, and save it to your intents file.

```
ResponseOutput = CarterOffline.SendToCarter(input_string, User)

print(ResponseOutput)

```
