## Self-Contained `adapters` Library

This branch disentangles `adapter-transformers` from HF Transformers and adds Transformers as an external dependency.

### Breaking changes

- All adapter-related classes now have to imported via `adapters` namespace, e.g.:
    ```python
    from adapters import BertAdapterModel
    # ...
    ```
- Built-in HF model classes can be adapted for usage with adapters via a wrapper method, e.g.:
    ```python
    import adapters
    from transformers import BertModel

    model = BertModel.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
    adapters.init(model)
    ```

### Model support

- [x] Albert
- [x] Bart
- [x] BEiT
- [x] Bert
- [x] Bert Generation
- [x] CLIP
- [x] Deberta
- [x] Deberta V2
- [x] DistilBert
- [ ] Encoder-Decoder
- [x] GPT-2
- [x] GPT-J
- [x] MBart
- [x] Roberta
- [x] T5
- [x] ViT
- [x] XLM-R

### TODO

Features not (yet) working:

- Loading model + adapter checkpoints using HF classes
- ~~Text generation with adapters~~ (hacked working version)
- ~~Parallel generation with adapters~~
- Using Transformers pipelines with adapters
- Using HF language modeling classes with invertible adapters

Tasks to do for first usable version:

- ~~Remove utils folder and use utils of HF~~
- Make all tests passing
- Update example scripts w. breaking changes
- Update docs w. breaking changes
- Update contributing guides for new code structure

A friendly fork of HuggingFace's <i>Transformers</i>, adding Adapters to PyTorch language models
</h3>

![Tests](https://github.com/Adapter-Hub/adapters/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)
[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/adapter-hub/adapters.svg?color=blue)](https://github.com/adapter-hub/adapters/blob/main/LICENSE)
[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/adapters)](https://pypi.org/project/adapters/)

`adapters` is an extension of [HuggingFace's Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library, integrating adapters into state-of-the-art language models by incorporating **[AdapterHub](https://adapterhub.ml)**, a central repository for pre-trained adapter modules.

_ðŸ’¡ Important: This library can be used as a drop-in replacement for HuggingFace Transformers and regularly synchronizes new upstream changes.
Thus, most files in this repository are direct copies from the HuggingFace Transformers source, modified only with changes required for the adapter implementations._

## Installation

`adapters` currently supports **Python 3.7+** and **PyTorch 1.3.1+**.
After [installing PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/), you can install `adapters` from PyPI ...

```
pip install -U adapters
```

... or from source by cloning the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/adapter-hub/adapters.git
cd adapters
pip install .
```

## Getting Started

HuggingFace's great documentation on getting started with _Transformers_ can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/transformers/index.html). `adapters` is fully compatible with _Transformers_.

To get started with adapters, refer to these locations:

- **[Colab notebook tutorials](https://github.com/Adapter-Hub/adapters/tree/main/notebooks)**, a series notebooks providing an introduction to all the main concepts of (adapter-)transformers and AdapterHub
- **https://docs.adapterhub.ml**, our documentation on training and using adapters with _adapters_
- **https://adapterhub.ml** to explore available pre-trained adapter modules and share your own adapters
- **[Examples folder](https://github.com/Adapter-Hub/adapters/tree/main/examples/pytorch)** of this repository containing HuggingFace's example training scripts, many adapted for training adapters
