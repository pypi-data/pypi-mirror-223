Supercharge your LLM training with checkpointable data loading.

## Key Features

* **Checkpointing** - Epochraft operates completely deterministically, and allows for a full restoration of state through checkpointing.
* **Simple** - It's a minimally readable implementation that makes it easy for users to add sources and transforms.
* **LLM-Ready** - It is equipped out of the box with features necessary for pre-training and SFT of LLMs.



## Development


```
pip install -e .[development]
mypy .; black .; flake8 .; isort .
pytest tests
```
