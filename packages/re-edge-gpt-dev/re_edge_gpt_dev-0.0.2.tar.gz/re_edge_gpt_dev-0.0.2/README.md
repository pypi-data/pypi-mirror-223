## Install package

```bash
python3 -m pip install re_edge_gpt --upgrade
```

## Requirements

- python 3.8+
- A Microsoft Account with access to <https://bing.com/chat> (Optional, depending on your region)
- Required in a supported country or region with New Bing (Chinese mainland VPN required)

## Authentication

!!! POSSIBLY NOT REQUIRED ANYMORE !!!

**In some regions**, Microsoft has made the chat feature **available** to everyone, so you might be able to **skip this step**. You can check this with a browser (with user-agent set to reflect Edge), by **trying to start a chat without logging in**.

It was also found that it might **depend on your IP address**. For example, if you try to access the chat features from an IP that is known to **belong to a datacenter range** (vServers, root servers, VPN, common proxies, ...), **you might be required to log in** while being able to access the features just fine from your home IP address.

If you receive the following error, you can try **providing a cookie** and see if it works then:

`Exception: Authentication failed. You have not been accepted into the beta.`

### Collect cookies

- a) (Easy) Install the latest version of Microsoft Edge
- b) (Advanced) Alternatively, you can use any browser and set the user-agent to look like you're using Edge (e.g., `Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/111.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 Edg/111.0.1661.51`). You can do this easily with an extension like "User-Agent Switcher and Manager" for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-agent-switcher-and-m/bhchdcejhohfmigjafbampogmaanbfkg) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/user-agent-string-switcher/).

1. Get a browser that looks like Microsoft Edge.
2. Open [bing.com/chat](https://bing.com/chat)
3. If you see a chat feature, you are good to continue...
4. Install the cookie editor extension for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cookie-editor/hlkenndednhfkekhgcdicdfddnkalmdm) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-editor/)
5. Go to [bing.com](https://bing.com)
6. Open the extension
7. Click "Export" on the bottom right, then "Export as JSON" (This saves your cookies to clipboard)
8. Paste your cookies into a file `bing_cookies.json`.
   - NOTE: The **cookies file name MUST follow the regex pattern `bing_cookies.json`**, so that they could be recognized by internal cookie processing mechanisms

### Use cookies in code:

```python
import json
from re_edge_gpt import Chatbot

cookies = json.loads(open("./path/to/bing_cookies.json", encoding="utf-8").read())
bot = await Chatbot.create(cookies=cookies)
```

## Run from Command Line

```
 $ python3 -m EdgeGPT.EdgeGPT -h

        re_edge_gpt - A demo of reverse engineering the Bing GPT chatbot

        !help for help

        Type !exit to exit

usage: re_edge_gpt.py [-h] [--enter-once] [--search-result] [--no-stream] [--rich] [--proxy PROXY] [--wss-link WSS_LINK]
                  [--style {creative,balanced,precise}] [--prompt PROMPT] [--cookie-file COOKIE_FILE]
                  [--history-file HISTORY_FILE] [--locale LOCALE]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --enter-once
  --search-result
  --no-stream
  --rich
  --proxy PROXY         Proxy URL (e.g. socks5://127.0.0.1:1080)
  --wss-link WSS_LINK   WSS URL(e.g. wss://sydney.bing.com/sydney/ChatHub)
  --style {creative,balanced,precise}
  --prompt PROMPT       prompt to start with
  --cookie-file COOKIE_FILE
                        path to cookie file
  --history-file HISTORY_FILE
                        path to history file
  --locale LOCALE       your locale (e.g. en-US, zh-CN, en-IE, en-GB)
```

(China/US/UK/Norway has enhanced support for locale)

## Run in Python

### 1. The `Chatbot` class and `asyncio` for more granular control

Use Async for the best experience, for example:

```python
import asyncio, json

from pathlib import Path
from re_edge_gpt import Chatbot, ConversationStyle

cookies = json.loads(open(str(Path(str(Path.cwd()) + "/bing_cookies.json")), encoding="utf-8").read())

async def main():
    bot = await Chatbot.create(cookies=cookies)
    response = await bot.ask(prompt="Hello world", conversation_style=ConversationStyle.creative, simplify_response=True)
    print(json.dumps(response, indent=2)) # Returns
    """
{
    "text": str,
    "author": str,
    "sources": list[dict],
    "sources_text": str,
    "suggestions": list[str],
    "messages_left": int
}
    """
    await bot.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
