# HeST
Fast python-based yields simulation technique for producing LHe yields

This is an early developmental version of a yields simulation package. Further development will continue. 

## Install from pip

In the terminal, simply use: 

`pip install HeST`

Then in your python scripts you can use: 

`from HeST import HeST`

which will get you all of the functions in src/HeST/HeST.py

## Simple Example

A jupyter notebook, "ExampleUsage.ipynb" has been included for an example of how to generate events.
