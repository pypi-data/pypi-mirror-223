ChemPotPy is a library for analytic representation of single-state 
and multi-state potential energy surfaces and couplings. 

All fortran source code are stored in folder chempotpy
 
ChemPotPy currently requires python3.8
To install, please create a conda virtural environment that uses python3.8

Follow the following steps:
1. install Conda 
2. create a virtural environment that uses python3.8, for example:
   "conda create -n chempotpy python=3.8"
   which will create a virtual environment called chempotpy
3. "conda activate chempotpy"
4. "conda install numpy"
5. "pip install chempotpy"

The following paper should be cited in publications utilizing the
ChemPotPy library in addition to the original paper that publishes 
the potential energy surface subroutine:
