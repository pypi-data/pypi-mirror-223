"""Centralized String Constants for Sign Language Translator Package

This module defines enumerations for various string constants used throughout the package.

Enumerations:
    Countries (Enum): Enumerates supported countries with their short codes.
    Organizations (Enum): Enumerates supported organizations with their short codes.
    SignCollections (Enum): Enumerates sign collections with their names.
    TextLanguages (Enum): Enumerates supported text languages with their short codes.
    SignLanguages (Enum): Enumerates supported sign languages with their names.
    VideoFeatures (Enum): Enumerates supported video feature models.
    ModelCodes (Enum): Enumerates model codes for different models.

Functions:
    normalize_short_code (function): Normalizes a provided short code to a recognized standard form.
