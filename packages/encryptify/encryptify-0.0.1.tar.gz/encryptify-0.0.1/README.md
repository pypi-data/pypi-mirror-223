## Installation

Get started on your journey with BinaryCrypt by installing it using pip:

```bash
pip install encryptify
```

## Features 🌈

### Encrypt Function 🔐

The `encrypt` function takes your everyday text and turns it into a hypnotic sequence of dots and spaces. Watch your words transform into an enigmatic binary dance!

```python
from encryptify import encrypt

data = "Hello, world!"
encrypted_data = encrypt(data)
print(encrypted_data)  # Output: " .  .    ..  . . .. ..   .. ..   .. ....  . ..    .      ... ... .. .... ...  .  .. ..   ..  .    .    ."
```

### Decrypt Function 🔓

Decipher the enigma with the `decrypt` function! It transforms dots into 1s and spaces into 0s, elegantly converting binary text back into its original form.

```python
from encryptify import decrypt

binary_data = " .  .    ..  . . .. ..   .. ..   .. ....  . ..    .      ... ... .. .... ...  .  .. ..   ..  .    .    ."
decrypted_data = decrypt(binary_data)
print(decrypted_data)  # Output: "HELLO WORLD"
```

**Note:** Please ensure that you only use data with dots and spaces for decryption. Any other characters will lead to a charming `TypeError`.
