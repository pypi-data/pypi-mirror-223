def find_transitions(x, y, threshold):  # pragma: no cover
    """
    Given (x, y) chopper positions, find the transitions and other parameters.

    Given a chopper position in (x, y) coordinates, centered about (0, 0),
    return the index on (x, y) marking the `start` of the first transition,
    the index marking the `end` of the last transition, the number of
    `transitions`, the calculated `angle` between the two chop positions, and
    the `distance` from the center while chopping.

    This algorithm assumes that there are two chopping positions present in the
    (x, y) data (on and off) that are relative to a central (0, 0) nominal chop
    position.  A chop transition is marked when the absolute x or y position
    is greater than `tolerance` and of the opposite sign to the last detected
    chop transition.  Once a transition has been detected in both the x and
    y directions, the distance will be calculated as:

        d = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)

    for each subsequent (x, y) position.  The returned angle is weighted by
    distance (d) from the center and is given by:

        a = sum(d * arctan(s * y, s * x)) / sum(d)

    where s is given by:

        s = sign(y); x = 0
        s = sign(x); otherwise

    It is up to the user on how to best extract the chop amplitude from the
    data given the chop profile.  For a standard box-step chop profile, a
    median on the distances should suffice, while more advanced analysis
    should be applied to other patterns.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : numpy.ndarray (float)
        The x-direction chopper position of shape (n,).
    y : numpy.ndarray (float)
        The y-direction chopper position of shape (n,).
    threshold : float
        The distance away from the center (x, y) = (0, 0) that would be
        considered representing a single chopper transition
        (chopper amplitude).
