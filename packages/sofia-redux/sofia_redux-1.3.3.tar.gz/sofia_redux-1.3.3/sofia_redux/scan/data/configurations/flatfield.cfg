# ===========================================================================
# Configuration for generating flatfields.
#
# Description:
#       This configuration helps created flatfields based on the actual 
#       detector responses to the observed source structure. Note, this
#       works only if the source was observed with a scan pattern, which
#       moves ALL channels over the bright emission.
# 
# ===========================================================================

# Do not use prior flat values. Derive them all from scratch...
# Never decorrelate on sky gains, since we are trying to determine these
# Ignore flagging
# Do not bias maps
# Always sync the source (the coupling estimate is part of the synching).
blacklist = pixeldata, sky, flag, clip, source.nosync

# Do not smooth the images in the intermediate iterations.
forget = smooth

# Activate the routine that will determine source couplings for each pixel.
[source]
    # Specify the acceptable range of pixel couplings (source gain to
    # common-noise gain ratio). Pixels outside of that range will be flagged
    # as 'blind'.
    [[coupling]]
        value = True
        range = 0.1:10.0

# Write the flatfield data for re-use with SOFSCAN, e.g. via the 'pixeldata'
# option.
