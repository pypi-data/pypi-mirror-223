Order masks should be in Spextool format, with flat data in the image
array, if available, and order edges defined in the FITS header.

Note that a full set of order masks is included in the source
distribution of this package, but not in the pip or conda versions.
They may be downloaded separately, if desired, from the
`GitHub repository <https://github.com/SOFIA-USRA/sofia_redux>`__.
Otherwise, the software will attempt to automatically download and
cache the reference files as needed.
