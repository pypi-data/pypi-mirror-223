ATRAN data directory
====================

This directory contains data files for atmospheric correction.

Note that this distribution contains a minimal reference set, to
keep the package size small.  ATRAN files specific to observational
conditions may be generated from data provided by the
`ATRAN server <https://atran.arc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/atran/atran.cgi>`__,
or may be provided `on request <sofia_help@sofia.usra.edu>`__.  Full
libraries of ATRAN files for FLITECAM may be downloaded from the
`SOFIA website <https://www.sofia.usra.edu/science/data/data-pipelines>`__.
