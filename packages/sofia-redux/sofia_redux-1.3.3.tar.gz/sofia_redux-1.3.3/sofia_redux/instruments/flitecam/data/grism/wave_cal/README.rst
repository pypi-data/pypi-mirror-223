Wavecals should be in Spextool format, with wavelength calibration data
in the first plane of the image array and spatial calibration data in
the second plane.

Note that a full set of wavelength calibration files is included in the
source distribution of this package, but not in the pip or conda versions.
They may be downloaded separately, if desired, from the
`GitHub repository <https://github.com/SOFIA-USRA/sofia_redux>`__.
Otherwise, the software will attempt to automatically download and 
cache the reference files as needed.
