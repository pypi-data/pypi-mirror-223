Transmission data directory
===========================

This directory contains data files for atmospheric correction.

Note that this distribution may contain a minimal reference set, if any,
to keep the package size small.  PSG files specific to observational
conditions may be generated from data provided by the
`Planetary Spectrum Generator <https://psg.gsfc.nasa.gov/>`__.  Full
libraries of PSG files for EXES may be downloaded from the
`SOFIA website <https://www.sofia.usra.edu/science/data/data-pipelines>`__.
