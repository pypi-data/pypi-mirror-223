# ===========================================================================
# Configuration for generating flatfields.
#
# Description:
#       This configuration helps created flatfields based on the actual 
#       detector responses to the observed source structure. Note, this
#       works only if the soruce was observed with a scan pattern, which
#       moves ALL channels over the bright emission. (E.g. raster scans
#       on OMC-1...)    
# 
# ===========================================================================

# Ignore flagging
# Never decorrelate on sky gains, since we are trying to determine these
# Always determine flatfields for all subarrays, by never allowing to reduce
# with a subarray selection.
blacklist = flag.row, flag.mux, sky, subarray

# Disable decorrelating on array substructures, such as bias lines, SQUID
# muxes, or detector rows. They can interfere with the derivation of robust
# flatfields.
forget = biaslines, mux, rows

# Write the flatfield data for used with the DRP pipeline.
