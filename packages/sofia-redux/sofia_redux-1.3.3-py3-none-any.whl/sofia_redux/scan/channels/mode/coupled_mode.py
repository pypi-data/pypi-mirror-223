        Return the gain values of the mode.

        If no gains are available and no gain provider is available, will
        return an array of ones.  The final output gains are the product of
        the parent mode gains and the gains of the coupled mode.

        Note that this is a correlated mode, so the gains retrieved from the
        gain provider will be normalized w.r.t the typical gain magnitude of
        the gain flagged channels before being multiplied by the parent gains.

        Parameters
        ----------
        validate : bool, optional
            If `True` (default), will cause the gain provider to "validate"
            the mode itself, and the parent mode to which it is coupled.  This
            could mean anything and is dependent on each gain provider.

        Returns
        -------
        gains : numpy.ndarray (float)
            The gain values returned are the product of the parent gains, and
            the coupled mode gains.
