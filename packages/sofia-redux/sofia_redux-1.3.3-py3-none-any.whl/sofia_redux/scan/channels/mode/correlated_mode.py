        """
        Create a correlated mode operating on a given channel group.

        A mode is an object that is applied to a given channel group, defining
        what constitutes its "gain" and how to operate thereon.  This is
        also dependent on a gain provider.

        The correlated mode normalizes gains by the typical gain magnitude.
        It also provides methods to update signals in an integration.

        Parameters
        ----------
        channel_group : ChannelGroup, optional
            The channel group owned by the mode.
        gain_provider : str or GainProvider, optional
            If a string is provided a `FieldGainProvider` will be set to
            operate on the given field of the channel group.
        name : str, optional
            The name of the mode.  If not provided, will be determined from the
            channel group name (if available).

        Apply a channel group to the correlated mode.

        ignore by the correlated mode.

        If no gains are available and no gain provider is available, will
        return an array of ones.  The gains returned will always be normalized
        with respect to the typical gain values of the gain flagged channels.

        Parameters
        ----------
        validate : bool, optional
            If `True` (default), will cause the gain provider to "validate"
            the mode itself.  This could mean anything and is dependent on the
            gain provider.

        Set the gain values of the mode.

        If a gain provider is available, it will be used to update the gain
        values, which could also update values in the channel group.  Gains
        may be flagged depending on whether a gain range has been set
        (in the `gain_range` attribute).  Note that any flagging will back
        propagate to the channel group and therefore, the channels themselves.

            If `True`, will flag gain values outside the gain range after
            normalizing to the average gain value of those previously flagged.

        Returns
        -------

            any channels were flagged, just that it was attempted.

        Normalizes the supplied (or contained) gains and returns the average.

        If no gains are supplied, they are retrieved from the gain provider and
        normalized by the typical gain magnitude of the gain flagged channels.
        Note that if this is the case, the gain provider will store the
        normalized values.  The average (normalization factor) is returned to
        the caller.

        Note that unlike the parent Mode class, average gain values are those
        derived from channels only flagged by the gain type flag, not those
        that include the gain flag.  However, no flagging of gain values will
        occur.
