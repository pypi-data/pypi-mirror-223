        An abstract response mode.

        A mode is an object that is applied to a given channel group, defining
        what constitutes its "gain" and how to operate thereon.  This is
        also dependent on a gain provider.

        The response mode contains the additional `get_signal` method to
        extract a Signal object from an integration.

        Parameters
        ----------
        channel_group : ChannelGroup, optional
            The channel group owned by the mode.
        gain_provider : str or GainProvider, optional
            If a string is provided a `FieldGainProvider` will be set to
            operate on the given field of the channel group.
        name : str, optional
            The name of the mode.  If not provided, will be determined from the
            channel group name (if available).
