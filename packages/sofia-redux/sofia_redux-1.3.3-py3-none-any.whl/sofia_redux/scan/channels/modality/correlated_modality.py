        Create a correlated modality.

        A Modality is a collection of channel modes.  A channel mode
        extracts/sets/operates-on gains from a channel group (collection
        of channels).  Modes are created by the modality from a channel
        division which is a collection of channel groups.  The type of
        mode may be explicitly defined or will be set to a default mode
        class for the modality.

        The name of the modality should be set, as it is used by the
        modality to apply specific configuration options.

        The correlated modality is similar to the standard Modality but allows
        additional functionality to operate on correlated modes such as the
        ability to update signals in an integration.

        Parameters
        ----------
        name : str, optional
            The name of the modality.
        identity : str, optional
            A shorthand abbreviation for the modality.
        channel_division : ChannelDivision, optional
            A ChannelDivision object containing groups from which to create
            channel modes.
        gain_provider : GainProvider or str, optional
            If a string is provided, a FieldGainProvider will be created that
            defined the gain as that field of the channel group data.
            If a gain provider is explicitly provided, it will be used instead.
        mode_class : Mode, optional
            The mode class to be used when creating modes from the channel
            groups inside the channel division.  If not supplied, the default
            mode class for a modality will be used.

        The following information is extracted and applied:

        1. resolution (in seconds)

        Parameters
        ----------
        configuration : Configuration or dict
            Either a configuration object, or a specific subsection of
            a configuration relevant to the modality.
        branch : str, optional
            If a configuration object was provided, specifies the branch
            that applies to this modality.  If not supplied, the branch
            name is defined as the modality name.
