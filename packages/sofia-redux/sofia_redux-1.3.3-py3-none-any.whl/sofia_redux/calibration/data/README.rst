Data directory
==============

This directory contains data files included with the package source
code distribution. Note that this is intended only for relatively small files
- large files should be externally hosted and downloaded as needed.

Note that currently, two levels of subdirectories are expected.  Modify
the setup.py package_data if more are needed.
