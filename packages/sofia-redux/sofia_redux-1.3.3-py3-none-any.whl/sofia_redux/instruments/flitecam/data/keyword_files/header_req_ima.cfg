# FLITECAM imaging header requirements configuration file
#
# Keywords in this list are only those required for successful
# data reduction (grouping and processing).  There may be more
# keywords required by the SOFIA DCS.
#
# Requirement value should be *, nodding, or dithering,
# (as denoted by the corresponding FITS keywords).
# * indicates a keyword that is required for all data.  All
# others will only be checked if they are appropriate to the
# mode of the input data.
#
# DRange is not required to be present in the configuration --
# if missing, the keyword will be checked for presence only.  If
# drange is present, it will be checked for an enum requirement
# first; other requirements are ignored if present.  Min/max
# requirements are only used for numerical types, and are inclusive
# (i.e. the value may be >= min and <= max).
