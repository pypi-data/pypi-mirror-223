# Dates are in YYYYMMDD format, and mark the endpoint of applicability
# (i.e. a line applies to files up to and including the listed date).
# Dates must be listed in order. Defaults for current data should be
# listed last, with date 99999999.  If there is no appropriate file,
# the entry should contain a '.'. Paths are relative to the data
# directory for the package.
