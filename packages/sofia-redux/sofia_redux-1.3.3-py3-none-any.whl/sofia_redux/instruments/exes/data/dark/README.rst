The dark file should be a raw EXES FITS file, containing reset dark
data appropriate for a particular series.

Note that the default files are included in the source distribution of this
package, but not in the pip or conda versions. They may be downloaded
separately, if desired, from the
`GitHub repository <https://github.com/SOFIA-USRA/sofia_redux>`__.
Otherwise, the software will attempt to automatically download and
cache the reference file as needed.
