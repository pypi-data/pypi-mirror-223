        r"""
        Create a tree structure for use with the resampling algorithm.

        The resampling tree is primarily responsible for deriving and
        storing all independent variables necessary for polynomial fitting,
        as well as allowing fast access to those variables that belong to
        coordinates within a certain radius of a given point.

        TREE STRUCTURE AND ACCESS

        The tree itself is divided into N-dimensional blocks, each of which
        is allocated a set of coordinates.  The width of these blocks should
        correspond to the `window` (:math:`\Omega`) defined in the resampling
        algorithm, and coordinates should be scaled accordingly.  For example,
        if the window radius is set to :math:`\Omega=4` in (arbitrary) units
        for the purposes of resampling 1-dimensional data, and the independent
        values are:

            x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

        They should be supplied to the tree as :math:`x^\prime = x / \Omega`.

        .. math::

            x^\prime = \frac{x}{\Omega} =
                [0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.25, 2.5]

        The tree defines blocks by grouping all coordinates with the same
        floored values into a single block.  Therefore, in this case the tree
        will contain 3 blocks.  The first contains [0.25, 0.5, 0.75], the
        second contains [1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75], and the third contains
        [2, 2.25, 2.5].

        The reasoning behind the whole tree structure is to allow for easy
        extraction of all coordinates within range of a user supplied
        coordinate.  This is done in two stages:  The first is to find out
        which block the user supplied coordinate belongs to.  We can then
        quickly narrow down the search by recognizing that coordinates in the
        tree population inside the window region of the supplied coordinate
        must either belong to the same block, or to immediately neighboring
        blocks since each block of the tree is the same width as the window
        radius.

        Once all candidates have been identified, the next step is to keep
        only those that are within a radius :math:`\Omega` of the user supplied
        coordinate.  This can be accomplished quickly using the ball-tree
        algorithm (see :func:`sklearn.neighbors.BallTree`.

        In practice, the resampling algorithm loops through each block of
        the tree in parallel.  For each block, all user supplied coordinates
        (points at which a fit is required) within that block, and all tree
        members within the neighborhood (the block and all adjacent blocks
        including diagonals) are evaluated in one step by the ball-tree
        algorithm so that for each point, we quickly get all tree members
        within that point's window region.

        POLYNOMIAL ORDER AND TERMS

        The resampling tree is also responsible for deriving all polynomial
        terms for the fit as well as mapping these terms to the derivative of
        the function.  Please see :func:`power_product`,
        :func:`polynomial_exponents`, and :func:`polynomial_derivative_map`
        for further details.  It is also possible to calculate terms for
        a range of orders in the case where order may vary to accommodate
        fits where insufficient samples are present.  To allow `order` to
        vary, set `fix_order` to `False`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        argument : numpy.ndarray (n_features, n_samples) or n-tuple
            Either the independent coordinates of samples in n_features-space,
            or the shape defining the skeleton of the tree.
        shape : n-tuple, optional
            If coordinates were supplied with `argument`, the shape of the
            tree to build.  Otherwise, the shape will be determined from the
            coordinate values in each dimension as
            floor(max(coordinates[i])) + 1 for dimension i.
        build_type : str, optional
            Must be one of {'hood', 'balltree', 'all', None}.  Defines the
            type of tree structures to create.
        order : int or array_like (n_features,), optional
           The symmetrical or asymmetrical orders respectively.  Symmetrical
           orders are selected by supplying an integer to this parameter.
        fix_order : bool, optional
            If `order` is symmetrical, allow for a varying order in an attempt
            to pass the order validation algorithm (the order can only
            decrease).
        balltree_metric : str or sklearn.neighbors.DistanceMetric object
            The distance metric to use for the tree. Default=’minkowski’ with
            p=2 (that is, a euclidean metric). See the documentation of the
            :func:`sklearn.neighbors.DistanceMetric` class for a list of
            available metrics. ball_tree.valid_metrics gives a list of the
            metrics which are valid for BallTree.
        leaf_size : int, optional
            If `build_type` was set to 'all' or 'balltree', defines the leaf
            size of the BallTree.  Please see
            :func:`sklearn.neighbors.BallTree` for further details.
        large_data : bool, optional
            If `True`, indicates that this resampling algorithm will run on
            a large set of data, and the ball tree should be created on
            subsets of the data.
        distance_kwargs : dict, optional
            Optional keyword arguments passed into
            :func:`sklearn.neighbors.DistanceMetric`.  The default is to use
            the "minkowski" definition with `p=2`, i.e., the Euclidean
            definition.

        Set the order(s) of polynomial fit for the resampling algorithm tree.

        In addition to declaring the desired order of polynomial fit, the user
        may also opt to select an algorithm to validate the desired order of
        fit is possible given a distribution of samples.  Please see
        :func:`resample_utils.check_orders` for a full description of available
        algorithms.

        Throughout the resampling algorithm, orders are classified as either
        "symmetrical" or "asymmetrical".  An order is termed as symmetrical
        if it is the same for all features of the polynomial fit.  i.e., the
        maximum exponent for each feature in a polynomial equation will be
        equal to the order.  For example, a 2-dimensional 2nd order polynomial
        is of the form:

        .. math::

            f(x, y) = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + c_3 y + c_4 x y + c_5 y^2

        where the maximum exponent for :math:`x` and :math:`y` in any
        term is 2.

        An order is considered "asymmetrical" if orders are not equal across
        features or dimensions.  For example, a 2-dimensional polynomial with
        an order of 1 in :math:`x`, and 2 in :math:`y` would have the form:

        .. math::

            f(x, y) = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 y + c_3 x y + c_4 y^2

        where the maximum exponent of :math:`x` is 1, and the maximum exponent
        of :math:`y` is 2.

        If orders are symmetrical, the user can allow the order to vary such
        that it passes the order validation algorithm.  For instance, if only
        2 samples exist for a 1-dimensional polynomial fit, and the user
        requested a 2nd order polynomial fit, the resampling algorithm will
        lower the order to 1, so that a fit can be performed (if the algorithm
        worked by counting the number of available samples).  If orders are
        asymmetrical, this option is not available and fits will be aborted
        if they fail the order validation algorithm.

        Parameters
        ----------
        order : int or array_like (n_features,)
           The symmetrical or asymmetrical orders respectively.
        fix_order : bool, optional
