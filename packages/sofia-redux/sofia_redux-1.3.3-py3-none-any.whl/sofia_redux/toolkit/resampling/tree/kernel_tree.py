        r"""
        Create a tree structure for use with the kernel resampling algorithm.

        The resampling tree is primarily responsible for deriving and
        storing all independent variables necessary for kernel fitting,
        as well as allowing fast access to those variables that belong to
        coordinates within a certain radius of a given point.

        TREE STRUCTURE AND ACCESS

        The tree itself is divided into N-dimensional blocks, each of which
        is allocated a set of coordinates.  The width of these blocks should
        correspond to the `window` (:math:`\Omega`) defined in the resampling
        algorithm, and coordinates should be scaled accordingly.  For example,
        if the window radius is set to :math:`\Omega=4` in (arbitrary) units
        for the purposes of resampling 1-dimensional data, and the independent
        values are:

            x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

        They should be supplied to the tree as :math:`x^\prime = x / \Omega`.

        .. math::

            x^\prime = \frac{x}{\Omega} =
                [0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.25, 2.5]

        The tree defines blocks by grouping all coordinates with the same
        floored values into a single block.  Therefore, in this case the tree
        will contain 3 blocks.  The first contains [0.25, 0.5, 0.75], the
        second contains [1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75], and the third contains
        [2, 2.25, 2.5].

        The reasoning behind the whole tree structure is to allow for easy
        extraction of all coordinates within range of a user supplied
        coordinate.  This is done in two stages:  The first is to find out
        which block the user supplied coordinate belongs to.  We can then
        quickly narrow down the search by recognizing that coordinates in the
        tree population inside the window region of the supplied coordinate
        must either belong to the same block, or to immediately neighboring
        blocks since each block of the tree is the same width as the window
        radius.

        Once all candidates have been identified, the next step is to keep
        only those that are within a radius :math:`\Omega` of the user supplied
        coordinate.  This can be accomplished quickly using the ball-tree
        algorithm (see :func:`sklearn.neighbors.BallTree`.

        In practice, the resampling algorithm loops through each block of
        the tree in parallel.  For each block, all user supplied coordinates
        (points at which a fit is required) within that block, and all tree
        members within the neighborhood (the block and all adjacent blocks
        including diagonals) are evaluated in one step by the ball-tree
        algorithm so that for each point, we quickly get all tree members
        within that point's window region.

        Parameters
        ----------
        argument : numpy.ndarray (n_features, n_samples) or n-tuple
            Either the independent coordinates of samples in n_features-space,
            or the shape defining the skeleton of the tree.
        shape : n-tuple, optional
            If coordinates were supplied with `argument`, the shape of the
            tree to build.  Otherwise, the shape will be determined from the
            coordinate values in each dimension as
            floor(max(coordinates[i])) + 1 for dimension i.
        build_type : str, optional
            Must be one of {'hood', 'balltree', 'all', None}.  Defines the
            type of tree structures to create.
        order : int or array_like (n_features,), optional
           The symmetrical or asymmetrical orders respectively.  Symmetrical
           orders are selected by supplying an integer to this parameter.
        fix_order : bool, optional
            If `order` is symmetrical, allow for a varying order in an attempt
            to pass the order validation algorithm (the order can only
            decrease).
        balltree_metric : str or sklearn.neighbors.DistanceMetric object
            The distance metric to use for the tree. Default=’minkowski’ with
            p=2 (that is, a euclidean metric). See the documentation of the
            :func:`sklearn.neighbors.DistanceMetric` class for a list of
            available metrics. ball_tree.valid_metrics gives a list of the
            metrics which are valid for BallTree.
        leaf_size : int, optional
            If `build_type` was set to 'all' or 'balltree', defines the leaf
            size of the BallTree.  Please see
            :func:`sklearn.neighbors.BallTree` for further details.
        kernel : numpy.ndarray (float)
            The kernel to apply as an array with n_features dimensions.
        kernel_spacing : float or numpy.ndarray (float), optional
            The spacing between kernel elements for all or each feature.  If
            an array is supplied, should be of shape (n_features,).
        kernel_offsets : tuple or array_like, optional
            If the kernel is regular, should be an n-dimensional tuple
            containing the grid indices in each dimension.  Otherwise, should
            be an array of shape (n_dimensions, kernel.size).
        smoothing : float, optional
            Used to specify the smoothing factor.  If set to `None`, the
            smoothing will be determined based on user settings or input data.
            If `exact` is `True`, smoothing will be disabled (zero).  If
            `exact` is `False`, smoothing will be set to n - sqrt(2 * n)
            where n is the number of data values.  For interpolation, smoothing
            should be set to zero.  Smoothing must be >= 0.
        imperfect : bool, optional
            If a spline fit to the kernel is allowed to be imperfect (`True`),
            will only raise an error on spline fitting if a major error was
            encountered.  Otherwise, fits will be permitted so long as a
            solution was reached, even if that solution did not meet
            expectations.
        degrees : int or numpy.ndarray (int), optional
            The degree of spline to fit in each dimension.  Either a scalar can
            be supplied pertaining to all dimensions, or an array of shape
            (n_dimensions,) can be used.
        large_data : bool, optional
            If `True`, indicates that this resampling algorithm will run on
            a large set of data, and the ball tree should be created on
            subsets of the data.
        spline_kwargs : dict, optional
            Optional keyword arguments for spline initialization.  Please see
            :class:`Spline` for further details.
        distance_kwargs : dict, optional
            Optional keyword arguments passed into
            :func:`sklearn.neighbors.DistanceMetric`.  The default is to use
            the "minkowski" definition with `p=2`, i.e., the Euclidean
            definition.

        Fit a spline to the tree kernel.

        Parameters
        ----------
        degrees : int or numpy.ndarray (int), optional
            The degree of spline to fit in each dimension.  Either a scalar can
            be supplied pertaining to all dimensions, or an array of shape
            (n_dimensions,) can be used.
        smoothing : float, optional
            Used to specify the smoothing factor.  If set to `None`, the
            smoothing will be determined based on user settings or input data.
            If `exact` is `True`, smoothing will be disabled (zero).  If
            `exact` is `False`, smoothing will be set to n - sqrt(2 * n)
            where n is the number of data values.  For interpolation,
            smoothing should be set to zero.  Smoothing must be >= 0.
        spline_kwargs : dict, optional
            Please see :class:`Spline` for a list of all spline initialization
            keyword arguments.  Note that `solve` will always be set to `True`.

        Raises
        ------
        RuntimeError
           If the fit to the kernel was not adequate for further fitting.  If
           no further tweaking of the input parameters is possible, set
           `imperfect`=`True` during initialization, or manually set the
           `imperfect` attribute to `True` manually.

        Returns
        -------
        None
