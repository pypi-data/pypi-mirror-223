    Applies patches to known subclasses of str

    Problem statement: the cast/new hook for subclasses of str does not work
    without funchook. This seems to be an issue with timing: subclasses that
    are defined *after* our (non-funchook) extension hooks are applied do not
    appear to have a problem.

    However, even with the runner, our instrumentation is not necessarily going
    to be early enough to affect *all* subclasses that are defined.

    The solution is to use the garbage collector to find any subclasses of str
    that may already be defined at this point in time. We then explicitly apply
    propagation patches to the __new__ methods of these classes.
