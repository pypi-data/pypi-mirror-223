Only residues that are within ``nlist_cutoff_Ang`` in that frame are considered potential neighbors, s.t. non-necessary distances between distant domains aren't unnecessarily computed, like the N-term of a receptor and Gamma sub-unit of a G-protein. This is admittedly risky in some cases, and will likely change in future versions of ``mdciao`` (perhaps using kdtrees), but in general it works well if no large conformational changes take place during the simulation. \n",

    "From 1035 potential distances, the neighborhoods have been reduced to only 74 potential contacts.\n",
    "If this number is still too high (i.e. the computation is too slow), consider using a smaller nlist_cutoff_Ang \n",

    "Some known cases where the assumption that initial neighborhood (up to ``nlist_cutoff_Ang`` Angstrom) already contains all potential neighbors doesn't hold: \n",

    "* **binding simulations**: \n",
    "  If in your first frame the binding partners are far apart, but get closer during your simulation, the actual neighbors will be missing in the initial neighborlist. Binding partners can be anything: ligand and substrate, protein A and protein B, sub-unit $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, whatever you want. In these cases, you can either use the final frame of the simulation as a reference frame, or simply increase the ``nlist_cutoff_Ang`` to a value that captures all possible contacts, although this might slow down the computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **docking data**:\n",
    "  Docking data might contain many different poses where the ligand is sampling not only the orthosteric binding pocket, but anything else found by the algorithm. Since there's no single one representative frame for all this poses, you have to increase ``nlist_cutoff_Ang`` for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **randomized-data**: \n",
    "  In general, any type of data where there's a **strong expectation** of large conformational variability, beyond local rearrangements contained in the ``nlist_cutoff_Ang``, should be handled carefully.\n",

    "When computing whole interfaces, rather than just residue neighborhoods, ``nlist_cutoff_Ang`` is called ``interface_cutoff_Ang``, but it's the same concept. Since the user is no longer looking at individual residue neighborhoods, but rather entire interfaces between molecular fragments, i.e. (sub) domains consisting of many residues, we assume that larger conformational changes are expected and thus set the default value at 35 Angstrom."

E.g., the method [mdciao.cli.flare.freqs2flare](https://proteinformatics.uni-leipzig.de/mdciao/api/generated/generated/mdciao.flare.freqs2flare.html) automatically hides neighboring contacts via the ``exclude_neighbors = 1`` parameter.\n",
