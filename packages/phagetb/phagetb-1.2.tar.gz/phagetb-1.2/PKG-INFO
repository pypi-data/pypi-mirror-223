###PhageTB

PhageTB is a multilevel prediction method for predicting interactions between bacteriophages and pathogenic bacterial hosts. This study develops a novel host prediction method for predicting hosts of query phages by their genome sequences utilizing alignment-based and alignment-free features.

================================================================================

###nstallation

To install the package, type the following command:

pip install phagetb

================================================================================

###Getting Started

This project is hosted on [PhageTB](https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/phagetb/) and can be accessed by clicking on the link above or can be used as a standalone application by downloading the source code from this GitHub repository.

There are 3 prediction methods available in this model. 

1. Predict The Bacterial Host For A Query Phage (model.py (phagetb)

This Module Allows Users To Predict The Bacterial Hosts Corresponding To The Query Phages using the genome sequence of the phage. 

2. Predict The Lytic Phage For Query Bacteria (model_bacteria.py (phagetb_1)

This Module Allow Users To Predict The Target Phage Likely To Infect Query Bacteria.

3. Predict Interaction Of Query Phage-Bacteria Pair (model_phage_host_pair.py (phagetb_2)

This Module Allows Users To Predict Whether Given Phage And Bacterial Hosts Are Likely To Interact With One Another. The prediction from this module for the phage is used as a 
query for the BLAST task (blastn) against the query bacterial host. The BLAST task is performed using the NCBI BLAST+ tool. The BLAST output is parsed, and if the predicted host and query host have a similarity higher than the threshold, then the phage-host pair is predicted to interact.

================================================================================

###Minimum Usage

Following is the complete list of all options (with default values) that can be used to run the model. you may get these options by " phagetb -h" (and similarly for other modules).
