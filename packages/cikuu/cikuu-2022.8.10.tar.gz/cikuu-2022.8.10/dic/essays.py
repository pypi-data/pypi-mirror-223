However on account of the doctor's dereliction, his arm kept on bleeding. His face became pale. At this time, the driver asked passengers that it seemed that the hospital was near here, whether he could firstly send the man to see a doctor. Nevertheless it would change the route, and delayed the passengers' going home. \nIn my impression, Nanjing is a very crowded, fast-paced city. All the time, the citizens is unconcerned and ruthless for other people's things. However, they all shook their heads and said that never mind. Then the driver quickly changed the route of his bus. After a few minutes, the bus reached, and the driver personally send the old to the hospital. \nIn case that the company punished the driver, the passengers energetically left a message to the driver. It wrote their names and telephone numbers. And they said that if the company punished the driver, the driver could contact them and that they could prove that Mr. driver got out of line in order to help the old.\nThen the passengers got off and returned by the way that the bus came. \nSuddenly, the bus was empty. For my home is near the destination, Just I and a pool of blood left alone. Nonetheless my heart abounded in gratitude. For a moment, the driver came back, and I solemnly brought the message to the kind driver. The driver silently said: thank you.\nThat is my most moving day this year. Because I find that people around have done so many good deeds in silently. What's more vital is that everyone's soul is kind.

We talked and laughed with each other. We took photographs to remember the special occasion, but soon, girls felt tired and had no power to continue. So we decided to have a rest and had some food to replenish energy. We rested for a long time, then we continued. Through our endeavor, we arrived at the Zhongtian Gate of Mount Tai which meant that we would start the next most hard road. The road is the zigzag and tortuous paths of Mount Tai. We had a rest again so that we could have enough energy to continue our journey. We climbed carefully, because it is so abrupt. To each of us, it is a challenge. Through our endeavor, we reached the Niantian Gate of Mount Tai finally. That feeling was very cool, I had a feeling of pride. At the moment, the sun was sinking in the west, it was very beautiful and different from the sunset that we saw before. About 20 o'clock, we reached Yu Huang Ding which is the peak of Mount Tai. We were exhausted and hungry, but we were very happy and excited. We spent the night in the hotel, because the weather was very cold.\n Next day, we decided to go downhill from the other way. Most of us were exhausted and my leg had no strength to walk. I had a feeling that my brain couldn't control my leg. As the ancients said.\"up the hill is easy, down the mountain is difficult.\"I had a first-hand experience about it. \n When we arrived at the foot of the hill, we all were exhausted and very hungry, so we found a fast food restaurant and had a big meal. On the way to school, we all fell asleep so that we almost missed the chance of getting off the bus, fortunately, we did not. \n That day we had a good time, and achieved the dream of climbing the Mount Tai. I hope that I will have a chance to climb Mount Tai again in the future.

Recently, one thing arouses my indignation that I happened to encounter in a nearby supermarket which makes the day unforgettable.\n Standing by the cash desk,I was waiting in line to pay. A man wearing dusty clothes, diffusing a stinky and sea-like smell stood ahead of me. He was tall but bowed of humbleness. When it's his turn to check out, he put his commodities which were simple foods covered in plastic bags on the table. What was odd, the cashier didn't scan the goods but stared at the ragged man with an unfriendly look. Suddenly, she put her hand into the man's pocket on coat and rummaged swiftly.

The place our school located was not serious, but in order to be safe, we all were collected and stayed at the playground, everyone was forbidden to enter into the house.

We also talked lots of extremely interesting things that we couldn't help laughing and we found so many in common that we all regretted not having met earlier.\nIt was indeed the most unforgettable day in my life and I would remember it forever.", "essay_html": "", "tm": "", "uid": 607249, "sent_cnt": 0, "token_cnt": 0, "len": 1542, "ctime": 1353329197, "stu_number": "2012021605", "stu_name": "\u5f20\u9e4f", "stu_class": "1211", "type": 0, "score": 80.3618, "qw_score": 0.0, "sy_score": 0.0, "pigai": "", "pigai_time": 0, "gram_score": 0.0, "is_pigai": 1, "version": 14, "cate": 0, "src": "", "tid": 0, "fid": 0, "tag": "", "is_chang": 0, "jianyi": "", "anly_cnt": 1, "mp3": ""},
