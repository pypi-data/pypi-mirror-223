## Installation

There are 2 methods, one is through `git clone` and the other is by `pip install swarms`. Check out the [DOCUMENTATION](DOCS/DOCUMENTATION.md) for more information on the classes.

# Method1
* Pip install `python3 -m pip install swarms`

* Create new python file and unleash superintelligence

```python

from swarms import swarm

objective = "What is the capital of the Uk"

swarm(objective)
```

---

# Method 2
Download via Github, and install requirements. Simple example by:

* `git cloning https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms.git`

* `cd swarms`

* `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

* `python3 example.py`

* or create a new file:

```python
from swarms.swarms import HierarchicalSwarm

# Retrieve your API key from the environment or replace with your actual key
api_key = "sksdsds"

# Initialize Swarms with your API key
swarm = HierarchicalSwarm(openai_api_key=api_key)

# Define an objective
objective = """
Please develop and serve a simple community web service. 
People can signup, login, post, comment. 
Post and comment should be visible at once. 
I want it to have neumorphism-style. 
The ports you can use are 4500 and 6500.
"""

# Run Swarms
swarm.run(objective)
```

* Or just the worker no `BossNode`:

```python
from swarms import worker_node

# Your OpenAI API key
api_key = "sksdsds"

# Initialize a WorkerNode with your API key
node = worker_node(api_key)

# Define an objective
objective = "Please make a web GUI for using HTTP API server..."

# Run the task
task = node.run(objective)

print(task)
```

# Various agents

Here are some agents in the swarm you can use!

| Agent        | Import Statement                                   | Example Usage                                           |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| WorkerNode   | `from swarms import worker_node`                   | ```python api_key = "sksdsds" node = worker_node(api_key) objective = "Please make a web GUI for using HTTP API server..." task = node.run(objective) print(task)``` |
| Swarms       | `from swarms.swarms import Swarms`                 | ```python import os from swarms.swarms import Swarms api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY") swarm = Swarms(openai_api_key=api_key) objective = "Please make a web GUI for using HTTP API server..." task = swarm.run(objective) print(task)``` |

## Hierarhical Swarm

```python
from swarms import HierarchicalSwarm

swarm = HierarchicalSwarm(
    openai_api_key="your_openai_api_key", 
    use_vectorstore=True, 
    embedding_size=768, 
    use_async=True, 
    worker_name="My Custom Worker", 
    human_in_the_loop=True, 
    boss_prompt="You are a custom boss in a swarm who performs one task based on the following objective: {objective}. Take into account these previously completed tasks: {context}.\n ", 
    worker_prompt="You are a custom worker in a swarm who performs one task based on the following objective: {objective}. Take into account these previously completed tasks: {context}.\n ", 
    temperature=0.5, 
    max_iterations=5, 
    logging_enabled=True
)
result = swarm.run("your_objective")

```

# Docker Setup

* Build the Docker image

* You can build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile. Navigate to the infra/Docker directory where the Dockerfiles are located.

* For the CPU version, use:

```bash
docker build -t swarms-api:latest -f Dockerfile.cpu .
```
For the GPU version, use:

```bash
docker build -t swarms-api:gpu -f Dockerfile.gpu .
```
### Run the Docker container

After building the Docker image, you can run the Swarms API in a Docker container. Replace your_redis_host and your_redis_port with your actual Redis host and port.

For the CPU version:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 -e REDIS_HOST=your_redis_host -e REDIS_PORT=your_redis_port swarms-api:latest
```

## For the GPU version:
```bash
docker run --gpus all -p 8000:8000 -e REDIS_HOST=your_redis_host -e REDIS_PORT=your_redis_port swarms-api:gpu
```

## Access the Swarms API

* The Swarms API will be accessible at http://localhost:8000. You can use tools like curl or Postman to send requests to the API.

Here's an example curl command to send a POST request to the /chat endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"api_key": "your_openai_api_key", "objective": "your_objective"}' http://localhost:8000/chat
```
Replace your_openai_api_key and your_objective with your actual OpenAI API key and objective.

# Roadmap

Please checkout our [Roadmap](DOCS/ROADMAP.md) and consider contributing to make the dream of Swarms real to advance Humanity.

## Optimization Priorities

1. **Reliability**: Increase the reliability of the swarm - obtaining the desired output with a basic and un-detailed input.

2. **Speed**: Reduce the time it takes for the swarm to accomplish tasks by improving the communication layer, critiquing, and self-alignment with meta prompting.

3. **Scalability**: Ensure that the system is asynchronous, concurrent, and self-healing to support scalability.

Our goal is to continuously improve Swarms by following this roadmap, while also being adaptable to new needs and opportunities as they arise.

## The Plan

### Phase 1: Building the Foundation
In the first phase, our focus is on building the basic infrastructure of Swarms. This includes developing key components like the Swarms class, integrating essential tools, and establishing task completion and evaluation logic. We'll also start developing our testing and evaluation framework during this phase. If you're interested in foundational work and have a knack for building robust, scalable systems, this phase is for you.

### Phase 2: Optimizing the System
In the second phase, we'll focus on optimizng Swarms by integrating more advanced features, improving the system's efficiency, and refining our testing and evaluation framework. This phase involves more complex tasks, so if you enjoy tackling challenging problems and contributing to the development of innovative features, this is the phase for you.

### Phase 3: Towards Super-Intelligence
The third phase of our bounty program is the most exciting - this is where we aim to achieve super-intelligence. In this phase, we'll be working on improving the swarm's capabilities, expanding its skills, and fine-tuning the system based on real-world testing and feedback. If you're excited about the future of AI and want to contribute to a project that could potentially transform the digital world, this is the phase for you.

Remember, our roadmap is a guide, and we encourage you to bring your own ideas and creativity to the table. We believe that every contribution, no matter how small, can make a difference. So join us on this exciting journey and help us create the future of Swarms.
