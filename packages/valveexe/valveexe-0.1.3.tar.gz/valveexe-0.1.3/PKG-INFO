# ValveEXE

ValveEXE is a python library to interact with Source Engine game clients. It provides ways to input console
commands as well as ways to read console output. It is primarily intended to assist in creating modding tools.

Full documentation: https://pysourcesdk.github.io/ValveEXE/

> This library is completely VAC safe. It does not interact with memory in any way that might be
> frowned upon by anti-cheat. Console commands are issued either via RCON or by launch parameters.
> The console output is read from the disk, in log files provided by the game.
