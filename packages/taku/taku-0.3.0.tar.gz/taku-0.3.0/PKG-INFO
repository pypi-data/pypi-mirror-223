# Taku

Taku is a library for easy manipulating pipelined-tasks.  It manages intermediate caching, job depedencies, provide a easy interface to parallel jobs using multiple backends. Also, it supports direct instantiation of a torch `Dataset`, allowing for end-to-end data generation & training experience.

**Caveat**: Tasklib is only beta now, and for now only supports chained dependency (but one/multiple job in a task can be dependent on multiple/one jobs in another task).

## Development

```bash

```
