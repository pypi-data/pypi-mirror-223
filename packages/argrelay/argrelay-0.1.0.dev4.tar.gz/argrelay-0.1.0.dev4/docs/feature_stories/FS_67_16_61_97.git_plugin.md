These are a built-in pair of two plugins:
*   `GitRepoLoader`
*   `GitRepoDelegator`

Their primary intended use was testing - to load and query real data (Git repos, their commits, and other metadata).

Loading commits did not seem useful outside of testing.

And indexing repo locations and metadata is only helpful in practice when there are many Git repos to select from.
In this case, they can be indexed to select repo by various details like:
*   their aliases
*   type of content: code or config, etc.
