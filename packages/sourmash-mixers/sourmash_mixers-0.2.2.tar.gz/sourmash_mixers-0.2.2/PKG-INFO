# sourmash-mixers

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/sourmash-mixers.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/sourmash-mixers)

`sourmash-mixers` is a meta-package to install a number of useful
[sourmash plugins](https://sourmash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command-line.html#using-sourmash-plugins)!

Our intention is that all "suitably mature" sourmash plugins will be
available via `sourmash-mixers`, at least for now. "Maturity" rubrics
are defined
[here](https://github.com/ctb/sourmash-mixers/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/checklist-for-a-new-plugin.md), but it's an evolving criteria...

The list of plugins installed by `sourmash-mixers` is available [in `pyproject.toml` under **dependencies**](https://github.com/ctb/sourmash-mixers/blob/main/pyproject.toml) - the list includes:

* [a command-line plugin to produce 2- and 3-way Venn diagrams of sketches](https://github.com/sourmash-bio/sourmash_plugin_venn)
* [a command-line plugin to sketch many samples or genomes](https://github.com/sourmash-bio/sourmash_plugin_sketchall)
* [a command-line plugin to download NCBI genomes by accession](https://github.com/ctb/get-some-ncbi-genomes/)
* [a command-line plugin to filter hashes by presence/absence in multiple samples](https://github.com/ctb/sourmash_plugin_commonhash)
* [a command-line plugin to plot abundance histograms](https://github.com/ctb/sourmash_plugin_abundhist)

## Installation

This command:
```
pip install sourmash-mixers
```
will install the [latest version of `sourmash-mixers` from the Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/sourmash-mixers/).

## Usage

Command-line plugin subcommands can be listed by:
```
sourmash scripts
```
and detailed usage information for each plugin command can be seen with
```
sourmash scripts <command> -h
```
e.g. `sourmash scripts sketchall -h`.

You can list all installed plugins with:
```
sourmash info -v
```

## Developer information

existing plugin, please see
