# magnetocaloric 1.3.1
#### Developed by Supratim Das

Effective approach to determine magnetocaloric performance of any magnetic material using python programming. From isotherm M(H) curves, using the Maxwell Relation the magnetocaloric performance of a material can be calculated with the help of this module.

## What's New
- Relative cooling power (RCP) can be calculated.
- A method to visualize 'Full Width Of Half Maxima' has been employed.
- Another methods to illustrate Tricritical mean field model, 3D Heisenberg model and 3D Ising model have also been employed.
- Intuitive Graphical User Interface: Simplifying Program Interaction. Experience seamless interaction with our TKinter-powered UI. Standalone Python executable created using PyInstaller - no additional dependencies required.

For the Python programming approach, follow the steps in the README.


## Examples of How To Use

### 1. Installation 

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install magnetocaloric package.

```bash

 pip install magnetocaloric==1.3.1

```
### 2. Manage Excel Spreadsheet
-  Check the main excel spreadsheet from where the M-H data will be fetched by the program, data must be arranged in this format given below.

-  And add one extra magnetic field (Hmax + del_H) with null magnetic moment values. This is nothing else than to bring magnetic moment values of the last row under calculation.

- Create two new files (file extension xlsx) to hold the results obtained after the calculation and definitely make them closed, other wise XlsxWriter will not get access.

###  3. Execution
Run the code at any python based environment ( IDLE, PyCharm, Spyder etc.). But I recommend you simply execute this code using command prompt or IDLE. 

```python

from magnetocaloric import mcepy as mc

# Assuming `a` and `b` are provided by the user
mc.mce(a, b)


```
Here, 'a' is the total number of temperature and 'b' is the total number of applied magnetic field.
