    Execution context for multiple actions on the same value.

    To stop execution (including within one non-atomic action), the value must

    Stopping is local to a single `do` action and the executed value is
    returned without the `returned` flag.

    Throws `ReturningError` when trying to pass "returned value".

    `do` action is executed in the context of an empty arbitrary object that
    can be interacted with when decorating desired actions with `up`.

    Actions without `up` decoration are executed as if they were decorated
    with `saving_context |then>> up`.

    To write and read from context use `write` and `read` shortcuts
    instead of `to_write |then>> up` and `to_read |then>> up`.

    Contextualization is local to each `do` action: by default, you can't inject
    an arbitrary context to the top level, and the value from the `do` action is
    returned without that context (in the extracted view).

    To remove contextualization locality, call `do.openly` instead of just `do`.

    `do.openly` action will not additionally contextualize a value if it is
    already contextualized but still changes context to empty arbitrary object
    if it is `nothing`.

    `do.openly` saves the top context on return.

    Use the `doing` function to up non-upped components.
