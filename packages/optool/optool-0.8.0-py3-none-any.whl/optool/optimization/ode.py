    Representation of an ordinary differential equation (ODE).

    An ODE is described by the mathematical formula of the following form,

    $$ \dot{x} = f(x, u), $$

    where $x$ represents the state variable and $u$ the input variable that includes both controlled signals and
    disturbances.

    The corresponding implementation requires the definition of the state variable, the input variable, and the function
    $f$. The transcription then follows a multiple shooting approach, where the continuity is ensured via so-called gap
    closing constraints. In order to use the associated vector-based formulation, both $x$ and $u$ should be specified
    as column vectors, where $u$ has one element less than $x$.

class RungeKutta4:

    Fourth-order method of the Runge–Kutta for numerical integration.

    Runge-Kutta 4 is the fourth-order method of the Runge–Kutta family, which is the most widely used Runge-Kutta method
    and thus also referred to as the classic Runge–Kutta method or simply the Runge–Kutta method.

    One step of the Runge-Kutta method from $i$ to $i + 1$ is given by


    $$ x[i+1] = x[i] + \frac{1}{6}\, T_s[i] \big( k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4 \big), $$

    where the parameters $k_1, \ldots, k_4$ are recursively defined as follows:

    $$
        k_1 &= f \big( x[i], u[i] \big), \\
        k_2 &= f \big( x[i] + k_1 \tfrac{T_s[i]}{2}, u[i] \big), \\
        k_3 &= f \big( x[i] + k_2 \tfrac{T_s[i]}{2}, u[i] \big), \\
        k_4 &= f \big( x[i] + k_3 T_s[i], u[i] \big).
    $$

    Note that, if the time-derivative of $x$ is not dependent on $x$ itself, i.e., $f(x,u) = f(u)$,
    all parameters above are equal, i.e., $k_1 = k_2 = k_3 = k_4$. Hence, the Runge-Kutta method is equal to the
    Euler method.
