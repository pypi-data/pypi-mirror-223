# Optool - Optimization tools

Generally usable utilities related to optimization problems.

Optool is a comprehensive Python package that simplifies the formulation of numerical optimization problems by
supporting the use of units of measurements and parallel execution of optimizations.
In addition, the package includes advanced data validation capabilities and provides out of the box serialization of a
variety of well-known data types.

## Highlights

- Easy to use optimization framework built around [CasADi], allowing to specify the problem with units of measurements.
- Integrated data validation using [Pydantic].
- Additional Pydantic-compatible fields for a variety of well-known data types such as [Numpy] arrays, [Pandas] Series
  and DataFrame objects, unit and quantity objects of [Pint].
- Out of the box serialization to JSON of a variety of well-known data types within data models.
- Parallelization of optimizations with convenient redirection of logging statements.

## Installation

`optool` can be installed from PyPI:

```shell
python -m pip install optool
```

## Getting Started

The main purpose of this package is to simplify the formulation of optimization problems.
Following an [example application](https://web.casadi.org/blog/nlp-scaling/) of [CasADi], which aims to find the lowest
fuel consumption of a rocket in order to reach a certain target height, the corresponding optimization problem can be
formulated as follows:

```python
import numpy as np

from optool.optimization.ode import OrdinaryDifferentialEquation, ForwardEuler
from optool.optimization.problem import OptimizationProblem
from optool.uom import Quantity

# Define general parameters
time = Quantity(np.arange(0, 101, 1), "s")
gravitational_acceleration = Quantity(9.81, "m/sÂ²")
fuel_consumption = Quantity(0.3, "g/(N*s)")
target_height = Quantity(100.0, "km")
initial_mass = Quantity(500.0, "t")

# Setup problem
prb = OptimizationProblem.casadi("Rocket launch")
integration_method = ForwardEuler

# Decision variables
height = prb.new_variable("height", len(time), "m")
height.lower_bounds = Quantity(np.hstack([np.zeros(len(time) - 1), target_height.m]), target_height.u)
height.upper_bounds = Quantity(np.hstack([0.0, np.full(len(time) - 2, np.inf), target_height.m]), target_height.u)
height.nominal_values = target_height

speed = prb.new_variable("speed", len(time), "m/s")
speed.lower_bounds = Quantity(np.hstack([0.0, np.full(len(time) - 1, -np.inf)]), "m/s")
speed.upper_bounds = Quantity(np.hstack([0.0, np.full(len(time) - 1, np.inf)]), "m/s")
speed.nominal_values = Quantity(1500.0, "m/s")

mass = prb.new_variable("mass", len(time), "kg")
mass.lower_bounds = Quantity(np.hstack([initial_mass.m, np.zeros(len(time) - 1)]), initial_mass.u)
mass.upper_bounds = Quantity(np.hstack([initial_mass.m, np.full(len(time) - 1, np.inf)]), initial_mass.u)
mass.initial_guess = initial_mass
mass.nominal_values = initial_mass

thrust = prb.new_variable("control", len(time) - 1, "N")
thrust.lower_bounds = Quantity(0.0, "N")
thrust.nominal_values = Quantity(1.5e8, "N")

# Dynamic constraints
ode = OrdinaryDifferentialEquation(name="height_dynamics",
                                   state_variable=height.regular,
                                   input_variable=speed.regular[:-1],
                                   function=lambda x, u: u)
prb.add_equation(integration_method.integrate(ode, time))

ode = OrdinaryDifferentialEquation(name="velocity_dynamics",
                                   state_variable=speed.regular,
                                   input_variable=thrust.regular / mass.regular[:-1],
                                   function=lambda x, u: u - gravitational_acceleration)
prb.add_equation(integration_method.integrate(ode, time))

ode = OrdinaryDifferentialEquation(name="mass_dynamics",
                                   state_variable=mass.regular,
                                   input_variable=thrust.regular,
                                   function=lambda x, u: -fuel_consumption * u)
prb.add_equation(integration_method.integrate(ode, time))

# Objective
prb.objective = mass.regular[0] - mass.regular[-1]

# Solve
prb.parse('ipopt')
response = prb.solve()
for val in response.debug_info.get_details():
    print(val)
response.guarantee_success()
```

As a result, the optimal control strategy is to get the rocket to a high speed as quickly as possible, using a lot of
fuel, so that it is lighter and requires less thrust.
The propulsion is cut off after less than 10 seconds so that the rocket reaches the desired altitude in glide flight.

## Dependencies

The following libraries are necessary to run the program code.

- [CasADi] is a symbolic framework for numeric optimization implementing automatic differentiation.
- [Humanize] provides various common string-related utilities like turning a number into a fuzzy human-readable
  duration (e.g. *3 minutes ago*).
- [Loguru] intends to make Python logging less painful by adding a bunch of useful functionalities that solve caveats of
  the standard loggers.
- [Numpy] is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
- [Pandas] provides fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use features for data analysis and manipulation.
- [Pint] allows to define, operate and manipulate physical quantities.
  It allows arithmetic operations between them and conversions from and to different units.
- [Pint-pandas] provides an extension to Pandas, which allows Pandas to recognize the quantities and store them in
  Pandas data frames and series.
- [Pydantic] provides extensive data validation features and serialization capabilities using Python type hints.

Extra dependencies are needed for development, which can all be installed via

```shell
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

However, all processes are automated using [Tox], which automatically installs the
required dependencies.
Hence, [Tox] is the only Python package stringently necessary.
