# airfoil-generator

Airfoil coordinate generator based on various airfoil types: NACA 4-5 digit, CST geometry representation, PARSEC, and load from database.
The airfoil geometry can be manipulated so that it can has either closed or open trailing edge, manipulate the number of nodes, and draw it
like a charm! enjoy!
