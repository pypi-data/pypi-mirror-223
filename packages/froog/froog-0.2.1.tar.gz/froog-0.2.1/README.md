<!-- modern ml development is unintuitive, time consuming, and unaccessible. why not make it possible for anyone to build? -->
<!-- the goal of froog is to make a neural network libary to power any type of device from enterprise to small home robotics -->
<!-- machine learning is like making a lego. you combine standardized pieces, of all shapes and sizes, to create anything you imagine -->
<!-- froog is making those essential building blocks. -->
<!-- grug say never be not improving tooling  -->
<!-- ml toolkit -->

FROOG is a neural network framework that is actually **SIMPLE** with the goal of running machine learning on any device --> easily and efficiently.

<!-- This project should be art. Code is art. Machine learning should be easy to use, why do you need PHD's to able to create anything awesome with it?   -->
