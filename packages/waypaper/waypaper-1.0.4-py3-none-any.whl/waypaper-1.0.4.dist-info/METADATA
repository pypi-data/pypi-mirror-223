# Waypaper

GUI wallpaper setter for Wayland-based window managers such as Hyprland or Sway.

## Installation

(Under construction)

### Dependencies

- `swaybg`
- gobject python library (it might be called `python-gobject` or `python3-gi` or `python3-gobject` in your package manager.)

## Usage

`waypaper` will run GUI application.

To restore the chosen wallpaper at launch, add `waypaper --restore` to your startup config. For example, in your Hyprland config you can write:

`exec-once=waypaper --restore`

## Troubleshooting

- If wallpaper does not change, make sure that `swaybg` is installed.
- If application does not run, much sure to install gobject library (it might be called `python-gobject` or `python3-gi` in your package manager)
