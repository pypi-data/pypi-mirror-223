Description: PYTHIA is a program for the generation of high-energy physics collision events, i.e. for the description of collisions at high energies between electrons, protons, photons and heavy nuclei. It contains theory and models for a number of physics aspects, including hard and soft interactions, parton distributions, initial- and final-state parton showers, multiparton interactions, fragmentation and decay. It is largely based on original research, but also borrows many formulae and other knowledge from the literature. As such it is categorized as a general purpose Monte Carlo event generator.
