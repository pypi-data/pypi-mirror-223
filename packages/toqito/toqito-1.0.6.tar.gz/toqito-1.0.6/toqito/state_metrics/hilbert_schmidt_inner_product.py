    r"""
    Compute the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product between two matrices [WikHSO].

    The Hilbert-Schmidt inner product between :math:`a_mat` and :math:`b_mat` is
    defined as

    .. math::

        HS = (A|B) = Tr[A^\dagger B]

    where :math:`|B> = vec(B)` and :math:`<A|` is the dual vector to
    :math:`|A>`.

    Note: This function has been adapted from [Rigetti21]_.

    Examples
    ==========

    One may consider taking the Hilbert-Schmidt distance between the Hadamard
    matrix and itself matrix.

    >>> from toqito.matrices import hadamard
    >>> from toqito.matrices import pauli
    >>> h = hadamard(1)
    >>> hilbert_schmidt_inner_product(h, h)
    2
