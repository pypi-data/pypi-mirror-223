    Compute probability of single state exclusion.

    The *quantum state exclusion* problem involves a collection of :math:`n`
    quantum states

    .. math::
        \rho = \{ \rho_0, \ldots, \rho_n \},

    as well as a list of corresponding probabilities

    .. math::
        p = \{ p_0, \ldots, p_n \}.

    Alice chooses :math:`i` with probability :math:`p_i` and creates the state
    :math:`\rho_i`.

    Bob wants to guess which state he was *not* given from the collection of
    states. State exclusion implies that ability to discard (with certainty) at
    least one out of the "n" possible quantum states by applying a measurement.

    This function implements the following semidefinite program that provides
    the optimal probability with which Bob can conduct quantum state exclusion.

        .. math::
            \begin{equation}
                \begin{aligned}
                    \text{minimize:} \quad & \sum_{i=0}^n p_i \langle M_i,
                                                \rho_i \rangle \\
                    \text{subject to:} \quad & M_0 + \ldots + M_n =
                                               \mathbb{I}, \\
                                             & M_0, \ldots, M_n >= 0.
                \end{aligned}
            \end{equation}

    The conclusive state exclusion SDP is written explicitly in [BJOP14]_. The problem of conclusive
    state exclusion was also thought about under a different guise in [PBR12]_.

    Examples
    ==========

    Consider the following two Bell states

    .. math::
        \begin{equation}
            \begin{aligned}
                u_0 &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |00 \rangle + |11 \rangle \right), \\
                u_1 &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |00 \rangle - |11 \rangle \right).
            \end{aligned}
        \end{equation}

    It is not possible to conclusively exclude either of the two states. We can see that the result
    of the function in :code:`toqito` yields a value of :math:`0` as the probability for this to
    occur.
