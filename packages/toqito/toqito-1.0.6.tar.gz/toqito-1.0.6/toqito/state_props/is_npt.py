    Determine whether or not a matrix has negative partial transpose [WikPPT]_.

    Yields either :code:`True` or :code:`False`, indicating that :code:`mat` does or does not have
    negative partial transpose (within numerical error). The variable :code:`mat` is assumed to act
    on bipartite space.

    A state has negative partial transpose if it does not have positive partial transpose.
