(Theory of Quantum Information Toolkit)

The `toqito` package is an open source Python library for studying various
objects in quantum information, namely, states, channels, and measurements.

Specifically, `toqito` focuses on providing numerical tools to study problems
pertaining to entanglement theory, nonlocal games, matrix analysis, and other
aspects of quantum information that are often associated with computer science.

`toqito` aims to fill the needs of quantum information researchers who want
numerical and computational tools for manipulating quantum states,
measurements, and channels. It can also be used as a tool to enhance the
experience of students and instructors in classes pertaining to quantum
information.
