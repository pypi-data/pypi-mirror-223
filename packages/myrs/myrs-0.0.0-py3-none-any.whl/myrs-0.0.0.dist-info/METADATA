# 💧 Myr 

*"A Language and Compiler for Machine Learning"*

The aim of **Myr** is to become a **Domain Specific Language (DSL)** and **Compiler** for easily build **High Performance Machine Learning** solutions. **Simplicity** is at the roots of the language with a clean and simple syntax.
Myr use the [Python-Native Compiler Toolkit (xDSL)](https://xdsl.dev/) in order to leverage [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) and [MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/) compiler infrastructure.

The goals (first draft) :
- At first **satisfy my willingness** to learn more about DSL design, compilers and machine learning
- Be **useful**...(a hard goal 😅). The DSL should allow to quickly implement high performance machine learning algorithms (long-term goal)

## ⚠️ Warnings

For the moment :

- The development of the project takes place in a private github repository
- The project is at the very early stage -> Nothing is implemented in this version
 - The documentation is missing

Don't hesitate to contact me if you want to know more or are interested in !😃

The project will be highly collaborative🤝, so everyone is welcome to the project ! 🤗  
Contributions could be done in many ways and are not exclusively code. You could write documentation ( very important !😉), participate to the community creation (slack,matrix,gitter...) etc ...

The repository as well as a "usable" python package will be available in the upcoming months when the project will be more advanced. Stay tuned ! 🗓️
