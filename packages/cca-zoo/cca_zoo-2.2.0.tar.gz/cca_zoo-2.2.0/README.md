`cca-zoo` is a collection of linear, kernel, and deep methods for canonical correlation analysis of multiview data.
Where possible it follows the `scikit-learn`/`mvlearn` APIs and models therefore have `fit`/`transform`/`fit_transform`
methods as standard.

## Installation

You can install cca-zoo with pip or poetry. cca-zoo has an optional probabilistic feature that you can enable with the [probabilistic] suffix.

To install cca-zoo with pip, run one of the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
pip install cca-zoo
```

To install cca-zoo with poetry, run one of the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
pip install cca-zoo[probabilistic]
```

Can also use poetry to install:

```bash
poetry add cca-zoo
```

or

```bash
poetry add cca-zoo[probabilistic]
```
