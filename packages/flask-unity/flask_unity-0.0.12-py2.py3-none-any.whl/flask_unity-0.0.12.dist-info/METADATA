# Flask-Unity

An extension of flask web framework that erase the complexity of structuring flask project blueprint, packages, connecting other flask extensions, and other annoying stuffs.

## Installation

Install and update the latest release from <a href="https://pypi.org/project/flask-unity">pypi</a>. Basically the library was uploaded using `sdist` (Source Distribution) and `bdist_wheel` (Built Distribution), this software (library) is compatible and also tested with `windows OS`, `linux`, `macOS` and possibly can be compabible with others too!.

```
pip install --upgrade flask_unity
```

## Create flask project using flask_unity

After the installation paste the following command on your termianl

```
python -c "from flask_unity import project; project('schoolsite')"
```

This will create a project called `schoolsite` now cd into the `schoolsite` directory, if you do `ls` within the directory you just enter you will see a module called `thunder.py` and some directories (some in the form of package) `media`, `static`, `templates` and a directory with the same name of your base directory name, in our case it is `schoolsite`.

Boot up the flask server by running the below command

```
python thunder.py boot
```

Now visit the local url `http://127.0.0.1:5000` this will show you index page of your project

## Create flask app within your project (schoolsite)

For you to start an app within your project `schoolsite` shutdown the flask development server by pressing ( CTRL+C ) and then run the following command, by giving the name you want your app to be, in our case we will call our app `exam`

```
python thunder.py create_app -a exam
```

this will create an app (a new package called `exam`) within your project `(schoolsite)`

## Register an app

Once the app is created open a file `schoolsite/routes.py` and import your `exam` blueprint which is in (`exam/views.py`), default name given to an app blueprint, is the app name so our `exam` app blueprint name is `exam`, after importing it, append (register) the app blueprint in a list called `reg_blueprints` in that same file of `schoolsite/routes.py`

importing blueprint

```py
from exam.views import exam
```

registering blueprint

```py
reg_blueprints = [
  blueprint.default,
  blueprint.errors,
  blueprint.auth,
  base,
  exam,
]
```

once you register the app, boot up the flask webserver again by

```
python thunder.py boot
```

visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000` which is your project landing page

visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/exam` this will take you to your app landing page (exam)

visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/admin` this will take you to admin page. From there you are ready to go.

In this release we handle how we can customise the admin html page by inheriting (extends) it in our project templates/admin directory, and the admin page on how to bind models in the admin. Also I refactor other libraries that this package needs with their corresponding versions in the setup.py and requirements.txt files. In this release good documentations is well packed.

Database migration is added using `alembic`

Some error pages, default page were added but still you can customise it in your project sub folder (the package with the same name of your project in your project directory) in a file called `route.py`. Also an admin directory within your project templates folder is added too!

Possibly other well things are added which include auth system for `users` and more.
