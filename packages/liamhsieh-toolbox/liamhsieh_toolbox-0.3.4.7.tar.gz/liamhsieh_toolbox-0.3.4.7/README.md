# LiamHsieh toolbox

Latest update: Dec 21, 2022

This package is a collection of Python utilities created for benefiting my development of prototypes/applications regarding data-driven decision science a bit easier. 

<!-- Activate the virtual environment (venv) you want with the installation of this package, then run the following command to install this package for your venv:  

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/intel-sandbox/CnA-ODS-toolbox.git

```
or from downloaded project source code then unarchive (have to change to project root folder before running following command)
```bash
pip install -e .
```

The -e option is for editable install. It doesnâ€™t make a copy of the code into the venv folder. Instead, it makes reference to where the code has been placed. -->
