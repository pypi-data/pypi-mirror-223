## About

A collection of composite web elements based on components from [sphinx-design].


## Setup

Install the package using `pip install sphinx-design-elements`, and add the
extension to the list of `extensions` within your Sphinx configuration file
`conf.py`.

```python
extensions = [
    "sphinx_design",
    "sphinx_design_elements",
]
```

## Comparison to sphinx-design

This package uses low-level components of [sphinx-design], in order to build more
high-level elements on top.


## Development

[development documentation].

## Acknowledgements

Kudos to [Chris Sewell] and all contributors for conceiving and maintaining
[MyST Parser] and [sphinx-design].
