Headless interface to the `twinLab` library.

## Installation

Most users should use `pip`
```shell
pip install twinlab
```

If you want to modify the client-side code, or have a local installation, you will need to have `git`, `poetry`, and a `python` version of `3.9` or higher installed. Then you can do:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/digiLab-ai/twinLab-client.git
cd twinlab-client
poetry install
```

## Environment setup

You will need a `.env` file in your project directory that looks like the `.env.example` file in this repository
```shell
cp .env.example .env
```
and fill in your `twinLab` user details.

## Commands

Testing:

```shell
poetry run python scripts/test.py
```
where `test.py` can be replaced with any of the scripts in the `scripts` directory.

## Example

Here we create some mock data (which has a quadratic relationship between `X` and `y`) and use `twinLab` to create a surrogate model with quantified uncertainty.
```python
# Import libraries
import twinlab as tl
import pandas as pd

# Create a dataset and upload to the twinLab cloud
df = pd.DataFrame({'X': [1, 2, 3, 4], 'y': [1, 4, 9, 16]})
tl.upload_dataset(df, 'test.csv')

# Train a machine-learning model for the data
params = {
    'filename': 'test.csv',
    'inputs': ['X'],
    'outputs': ['y'],
}
tl.train_campaign(params, campaign_name='test')

# Evaluate the model on some unseen data
df = pd.DataFrame({'X': [1.5, 2.5, 3.5]})
df_mean, df_std = tl.predict_campaign(df, campaign_name='test')
```
